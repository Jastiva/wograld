<p>Defines types of {@link net.sf.gridarta.model.gameobject.GameObject
    GameObjects} with corresponding attributes. The game servers use different
    types of game objects, such as floors, monsters, traps, etc. Each of these
    types uses a specific set of attributes. Gridarta has no built-in knowledge
    about these. Instead it reads a configuration file, "types.xml", which
    defines game object types with corresponding attributes.</p>

<p>{@link net.sf.gridarta.model.archetypetype.ArchetypeTypeSetParser} implements
    a parser for the "types.xml" file. {@link
    net.sf.gridarta.model.archetypetype.ArchetypeTypeSet} is a model class that
    stores all type definitions.</p>
