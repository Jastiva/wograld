<H1 align="center">Onto the cool stuff</H1>

<P>So you know how to create a basic map - but that's not enough, is it? You
    want to do the "cool" things, using gates, levers, buttons, markers and
    whatnot. Create your own special monsters and artifacts...</P>

<P>Okay, so what you need to learn next is how the Crossfire objects really
    work.</P>

<P>You should know that every object has a <i>type</i>, defining it's base
    functionality. Is it a monster, an exit, food, or a weapon? That is defined
    by the object type. Apart from the type, there are countless
    <i>attributes</i>. A monster for example can have health points, attack
    type, a damage value, and many more.</P>

<P>There are two "layers" for the Crossfire objects (see
    <A HREF="tut_objects.html">manipulating objects</A>):</P>

<ol>
    <LI><b>The archetype syntax</b> - plain and ugly
        <br>
        <br>
        This is how the objects are defined in the arch files and also how they
        are stored in maps. Except for the special cases like type, name, image,
        and scripting, you can see the real arch syntax for any selected object
        in the <A HREF="tut_frames.html">Archetype Text Window</A>:
        <P>
            <IMG SRC="archtext.png" WIDTH="361" HEIGHT="234" ALIGN="CENTER">
        </P>
        However, this arch syntax is so cryptic and complicated sometimes, that
        it just isn't readable unless you've got lots of practice.
    </LI>
    <P>
        <LI><b>The attribute dialog</b> is there to help you
            <br>
            <br>
            Select an object on the map and double click on it in the
            <A HREF="tut_frames.html">Map-ArchPanel</A> (bottom-right window),
            or press the "attributes" button. You'll see a popup window: The
            so-called Attribute Dialog. This is an interface which tries to
            interpret the Crossfire arch syntax and present it in a user
            friendly form. This can help you to learn how things work! The &lt;Help&gt;
            button opens a type description, while the various &lt;?&gt; buttons
            offer explanations for each attribute.

    </P>
</ol>
<P>Apart from that, I recommend you to look at existing maps. Look how it's
    done, copy and experiment...</P>
