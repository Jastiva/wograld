    You are reading the Gridarta API Documentation. Gridarta is a Java program
    to create and modify maps for the MMORPGs <a href="http://www.atrinik.org/">Atrinik</a>,
    <a href="http://crossfire.real-time.com/">Crossfire</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.daimonin.com/">Daimonin</a>.</p>

<h3>UI Classes</h3>

<p>
    The most important UI class is {@link net.sf.gridarta.gui.misc.MainView
    MainView}. It is the main window, creates the main layout and holds all
    actions.</p>

<p>
    Map visualization is done by {@link net.sf.gridarta.gui.map.mapview.MapView
    MapView}, which renders the map, and {@link
    net.sf.gridarta.gui.map.mapview.MapView MapView}, which is a {@link
    javax.swing.JInternalFrame JInternalFrame} wrapping
    <code>MapViewBasic</code>. </p>

<h3>Data Model</h3>

<p>
    Each archetype is an instance of {@link
    net.sf.gridarta.model.archetype.Archetype Archetype}.</p>

    <dd>
        An Animation is a list of faces that defines the appearance of an
        Archetype in cases the appearance can change. The number of Facings in
        an Animation defines how many different sub-animations the animation
        contains. Such a sub-animation is for instance used to show the
        Archetype from different perspectives, depending on the direction
        (facing) of the Archetype. The number of Frames in an Animation defines
        the number of different faces used to display the Archetypes' appearance
        for a Facing. The Animations are not played by the Editor,
        <p/>
        It is possible to have an animation which holds different facings but
        only 1 frame per facing. Such animations are used to create "turnable"
        objects, that can face in different directions.
        <p/>
        It is possible to have an animation without a specified number of
        facings. Such an object is animated but does not change its appearance
        depending on the perspective.
        <p/>
        There are 2 ways for defining an animation. An animation can be
        anonymously defined inside a default arch; such animations inherit the
        name from the defining arch. Or an animation can be defined in a
        separate file in the <code>arch/</code> folder.
        <p/>
        Animations are NamedObjects, override Faces, they are implemented by
        {@link net.sf.gridarta.model.anim.AnimationObject AnimationObject} and
        {@link net.sf.gridarta.model.anim.AnimationObjects AnimationObjects}.
    </dd>
    <dt id="Archetype">Archetype</dt>
    <dd>
        An Archetype represents a single object including its description. There
        are two kinds of Archetypes, an instantiated Archetype called Game
        Object and the default Archetypes. Depending on the start mode of the
        editor, the default Archetypes are all loaded either from a file named
        <code>arch/archetypes</code> or by scanning the whole <code>arch/</code>
        directory tree for <code>.arc</code>-files. Game Objects are objects in
        maps and each of them refers to a default Archetype it is derived from.
        Each Game Object only stores the information that differs from its
        default Archetype.
        <p/>
        Additionally, an Archetype can be a so called Artifact. Artifacts are
        always read from a file named <code>arch/artifacts</code>. Currently,
        Artifacts are under migration. After the migration is finished,
        Artifacts are special "applyable" Archetypes. You'd select an Game
        Object and apply an Artifact on it, which would copy all Artifact
        attributes over the Game Object attributes.
        <p/>
        The class that implements Archetypes is {@link
        net.sf.gridarta.model.archetype.Archetype Archetype}. The class that
        parses text for modifying ArchObjects is {@link
        net.sf.gridarta.model.io.ArchetypeParser ArchetypeParser}. The class
        that holds all default Archetypes, including those for default
        Artifacts, is {@link net.sf.gridarta.model.archetypeset.ArchetypeSet
        ArchetypeSet}.

    <dt id="Face">Face</dt>
    <dd>
        The Face is the appearance of an Archetype. A Face is defined by a
        String that uniquely defines the appearance and is used to reference a
        corresponding graphic image, usually a PNG file. The {@link
        net.sf.gridarta.model.archetypeset.ArchetypeSet ArchetypeSet} contains a
        collection of all available faces.
        <p/>
        Animations override Faces.

    <dd>
        A Map is a 2-dimensional Matrix of Map Squares. X and Y define a grid
        representing a world surface. At those grid positions, Map Squares with
        Game Objects can be found and make up the world, its surface, obstacles,
        items etc..
        <p/>
        The Map itself is defined by a Map Arch Object. The class storing the
        Map is {@link net.sf.gridarta.model.mapmodel.MapModel}.
    </dd>
    <dt id="MapSquare">(Map )Square</dt>
    <dd>
        A Map Square is a Map matrix element. A Map Square holds zero or more
        Game Objects that describe the world in the map at the Map Square's x
        and y position.
