<h2>Checking out a normal working copy</h2>

<p>
    To checkout a normal working copy of the latest development, checkout the
    trunk. This is what's called HEAD or MAIN/LATEST in other version control
    systems. </p>

<p>
    <code>svn co https://gridarta.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gridarta/trunk
        gridarta</code>
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>
    Current rules are this: </p>

<ul>
    <li>
        All files need a mime type. For normal source code, use
        <code>text/plain</code>. Use this command to set the mime type:
        <br/>
        <code>svn propset svn:mime-type text/plain <var>filename</var></code>

        <br/>
        <em>Note:</em> A hook verifies that the mime type is set.
    </li>
    <li>
        All files with a text based mime type need a line ending setting.
        Gridarta convention is to always use <code>LF</code>. Use this command
        to set the line ending style:
        <br/>
        <code>svn propset svn:eol-style LF <var>filename</var></code>

        <br/>
        <em>Note:</em> A hook verifies that the eol style for files with mime
        type text/* is set.
    </li>
    <li>
        All XHTML files of the documentation (<code>src/doc/**/*.xhtml</code>)
        need a meta element for the edit date:
        <br/>
        <code><![CDATA[<meta name="Date" content="$]]>
            <![CDATA[Date$" />]]></code>

        <br/>
        Also, they need their keyword substitution set to <code>Date</code>. Use
        <code>svn propset svn:keywords Date <var>filename</var></code> to set
        the keyword substitution.
        <br/>
        <em>Note:</em> Because we cannot install custom hooks on SF, this is
        <em>not</em> checked with a hook.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Releases</h2>

<p>
    Releases are created in the following way: </p>

<ol>
    <li>
        A branch with the new release name is created. Usually the branch will
        increase the minor revision and use it as its name. Example: <code>svn
        copy trunk branches/0.8</code>. The policy for branches is that they
        aren't completely frozen, but only changes required for release and bug
        fixing are allowed.
    </li>
    <li>
        The branch is brought into releasable state. This usually should be zero
        effort, yet consider this a separate step.
    </li>
    <li>
        The release is published. As a part of the release publishing, a tag
        with the new release name and patch level is created. Example: <code>svn
        copy branches/0.8 tags/0.8.0</code>. The policy for tags is that they
        are completely frozen, tags must never ever be changed.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Checking out a released version</h2>

<p>
    To checkout a released version, use <code>svn co
    https://gridarta.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gridarta/tags/<var>version</var>
    gridarta</code> with <var>version</var> being the release name. To checkout,
    for example, version <samp>0.8.0</samp>, use <samp>svn co
    https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gridarta/tags/0.8.0 gridarta</samp>.
