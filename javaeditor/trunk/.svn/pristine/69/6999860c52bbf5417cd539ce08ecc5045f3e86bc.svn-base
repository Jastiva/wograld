Daimonin Editor Debugging:
-------------------------

The linux and win32 debugging programs were created to help users,
like your self, to identify any bugs in the editor, that are reported
by the debuggers. If a problem does exist you can forward the error
message that appears in your debugging console.


Intro:
------
In no way do you have to use either of the debuggers... they are simply
to help the development team in finding bugs.... If you are not running
the debuggers and come across what you think might be a bug. Restart the
editor with a debugger (Win32Debug) or (linuxDebug) and try to recreate the
problem.

Note: In order to be able to debug, you must have built the editor with
debug flag. To do so, create a file in daimonin/editor called
"developer.properties" and put a single line "debug=yes" in it. In case that
file already exists, look for a line starting with "debug=". If such a line
exists, change it accordingly, otherwise append such a line.
Then build the editor with ant -f make/ant/build.xml.

Win32 users:
------------
Just double click the "Win32Debug.bat" file this will run the
Daimonin Editor from the Command Prompt, thus allowing you
to see any system messages that may appear.


Linux users:
------------
Change to the editor directory (daimonin/editor)
Run the "debug/LinuxDebug.sh"
You will also get to see all the debugging info as well be able to use a Java
debugger to attach, set breakpoints, step through etc..


"I found a bug!!"
-----------------
If you find some sort of bug/error please copy the whole error message and
either past it in the bug forum @ http://www.daimonin.com or paste the message
into an email and send it to both daimonin@nord-com.net or chaotic_univerz@hotmail.com.
Also include your:
- operating system
- the last thing you did before the bug
(if you are emailing we will be able to solve your problem quicker... Also please
use the Subject Name "Editor Bug")

Good luck!
Thank you for your time, The Daimonin Developers.
