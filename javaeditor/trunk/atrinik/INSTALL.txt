How to run the DaimoninEditor:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Simply run the jar file "AtrinikEditor.jar" in the main directory.
In Windows this is done by a double click on "AtrinikEditor.jar".
In Linux/Unix you type in the console: "java -jar AtrinikEditor.jar".

The java runtime will be enough to run the client. Download it automatically
from sun. This will install the latest runtime using your browser.

NOTE: you need Java 6.0 (=1.6.0) or newer to run the editor.

** There is no need to install anything else (SDK, ...) except you want **
** compile the editor                                                   **

You can download the java RUNTIME here:

or this

If you edit many and big maps, it is recommended to run the editor
with a higher maximum memory size, like 128 Mb:
"java -jar -Xmx128m AtrinikEditor.jar"
(Note that in this way, the editor won't *always* use 128 Mb.
It will only use that much when it is required.)
For client users that edit normal maps (24x24 size) the default settings (which
is equal to -Xmx64m) is enough.


In case there is no jar file available, that means you will need
to compile the editor from the sources first. Read next paragraph.


How to build the AtrinikEditor from sources:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have checked out the AtrinikEditor sources from SVN, or
downloaded a "developer version", then you've got the Java sources.
Now you can modify the Java code, you can add classes, but please
don't move or rename any directories.

When you find yourself in the position that you want to compile
the Java sources for the editor, you have mainly these options:

1. Compile using Apache Ant.
2. Compile & Debug using Intellij IDEA.
3. Compile using one of the OS-specific build scripts.
   (There is no guarantee any of these works correctly.)
   (Keep in mind that the sources are UTF-8)
4. Compile "by hand" via command line.
   (Do not forget to add -encoding utf-8 for the Java compiler)

I strongly recommend using Ant for compile and IDEA for coding & compile.

I strongly recommend the supplied buildfile and running Ant directly, either
through your IDE's capabilities or the command line.

Visit <http://ant.apache.org/> for more information about Ant.


System requirements & Supported Java Versions:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You need at least 96 MB of system RAM and 400 MHz CPU speed
in order to run the AtrinikEditor. It has been reported to work
on systems with lesser specs, but the speed was very slow.
