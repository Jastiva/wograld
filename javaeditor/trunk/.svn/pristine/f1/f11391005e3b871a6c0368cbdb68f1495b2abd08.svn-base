<h1>Treasurelists</h1>

<h2>What are Treasurelists?</h2>

<p>Whenever a monster is generated or loaded in the world of Crossfire, items
    are placed in it's inventory according to the monster's treasurelist.</p>

<p>Hence, treasurelists define what items get dropped when the monster is
    killed. Even more importantly, they define which skills and spells the
    monster has at it's disposal.</p>

<p>You can view the treasurelists by selecting menu "Resources-&gt;View
    Treasurelists", or from the <a href="tut_objects.html">Game Object
        Attributes Dialog</a>.</p>
