<P><B>Icon Toolbar:</B>

    <br>
    Contains shortcuts for certain commands.
</P>

<P><B>Default-Archetype panel:</B>

    <br>
    This panel contains all the available default arches. You can select from
    the list and then eventually insert them into your map.
</P>

<P><B>Arch Info:</B>

    <br>
    This small window contains some basic info about the selected arch from the
    default-archetype panel. Personally I prefer to squeeze this to zero height,
    in order to have more space for the default-archetype panel itself.
</P>

<P><B>Map View:</B>

    <br>
    The Map View shows the currently open and active map. Here you can select,
    insert and delete objects.
</P>

<P><B>Map-Archetype Panel:</B>

    <br>
    This panel contains a list of all objects on the currently active
    (/selected) map square. Here you can select/insert/delete single objects,
    similar to how it works in the map view. Additionally you can change the
    stacking order of the objects by pressing the up/down arrows below the
    panel.
</P>

<P><B>Object Attribute Window:</B>

    <br>
    Here you have a small interface for the most basic attributes of the
    currently selected object. You can change it's name, face and message-text.
    Don't forget to click "Apply" to apply the new settings.
</P>

<P><B>Archetype Text Window:</B>

    <br>
    This window contains the arch-attributes of the currently selected object.
    You should know what you're doing when modifying these. See
    <A HREF="tut_objects.html">Manipulating Objects</A>.
    <br>
    Again, don't forget to hit "Apply".
</P>

<P><B>Status Bar:</B>

    <br>
    On the left side, the status bar displays the map-coordinates of your mouse
    pointer as you move it across the map view. On the right side, the current
    memory usage is displayed.
</P>
