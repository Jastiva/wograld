<H1 align=center>Loading Arches and Maps</H1>

<P>First off: What are Daimonin Arches? - They are the definitions of default
    objects, for example and ordinary orc, a door or standard food. These arches
    are vital for the editor and you can't work without them.</P>

<P>It is very important to know that there are two ways to load the Arches:

<ol>
    <LI><P>Load it from collected archive files. These should already be
        included in your editor and per default, these get loaded. Hence, if you
        don't want to care about arches, there's no need to worry about
        that.</P>
    <LI>Download the Daimonin arch package. You can download it either directly
        from CVS (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/daimonin/) or choose one
        of the download sites from http://daimonin.real-time.com/.
        <br>
        Once you've got the arch folder, you must <B>set the path</B> to this
        folder. Select the menu "File-&gt;Options...", un-check the box "Load
        Arches from Collection", then enter the path in the arch-entry. When
        you're at it, you can also customize the default map-path.
        <br>
        Now you're ready to go. Click OK, quit the editor and restart it. This
        time the arches will load from all the individual arch and image files.
        You will notice that the editor takes about three times longer to load
        that way.
</ol>
<P>You might ask yourself now: "Why should I spend my time downloading the arch
    package only to find out it takes three times longer to load?". Well, at
    some point during map making you will probably want to modify an arch,
    create new arches or new images. And for that task, you need to have the
    individual arch files in extracted form. However, don't worry too much about
    the loading time. You can collect the arches after modifying/adding what you
    want (see menu: "Resources-&gt;Collect CF Arches"). This will create new
    collected archives so you can both have your changes and load in short
    time.</P>

<P>Concerning maps: You don't necessarily need to have the Daimonin maps. You
    can just head off creating your own maps. Though, most likely you will
    notice that Daimonin map making isn't all that easy, and you'll want to have
    working examples to look at. Besides, you will want to link your maps into
    the existing Daimonin world and probably you'll want to test them too. For
    all of that you need the Daimonin map package.</P>

<P>Like the arches, you can get the maps either directly from CVS (see
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/daimonin/) or choose one of the download
    sites from http://daimonin.real-time.com/. Don't forget to set the default
    map path to your local map directory (menu "File-&gt;Options...").</P>

<P>Note that there is a special convenience option for browsing through maps:
    The "<B>enter exit</B>"-feature. You will probably know that in the Daimonin
    game, maps are linked to each other via so-called exits (doors, teleporters,
    buildings etc). You can select any such exit on a map (left click on it),
    then activate the menu "Map-&gt;Enter Exit" (or just hit &ltStrg&gt +
    &ltE&gt) and the map that this exit is pointing to gets loaded.</P>
