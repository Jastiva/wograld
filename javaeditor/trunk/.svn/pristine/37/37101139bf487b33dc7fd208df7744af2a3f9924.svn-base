<h1>The view settings</h1>

<p>Under the View-menu, you'll find three types of view settings:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="layout">the layout settings</a>
    <li><a href="view">the map view settings</a>
</ol>

<h2><a name="layout">The layout settings</a></h2>

<p>With the layout setting (Metal/CDE/GTK+) you can change the overall look and
    feel of the editor.</p>

<h2><a name="view">The view settings</a></h2>

<p>The map view settings are a nifty feature that allows you to select which
    types of objects you want to see &amp; modify. For instance, if you select
    "Show monsters" and "Show walls", the map view will display only that:
    monsters and walls. Even copy/paste actions will ignore all objects which do
    not match the active view settings.</p>

<p>This feature can be used to detect disguised exits, connected objects and
    more. You can also use it, for example, to copy objects without their
    background tiles.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the map view settings require pretty extensive calculations
    when applied for the first time. So, if you have several large maps opened,
    expect to wait a short moment after applying a new view setting.</p>
