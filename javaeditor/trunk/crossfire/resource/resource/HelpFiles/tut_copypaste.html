<h1>The Edit menu</h1>

<P>
    Often you will want to copy, move, delete or fill large areas of your map.
    To accomplish this, you can use the appropriate commands from the Edit
    menu.</P>

<h2>Undo and Redo</h2>

<p>
    Undo allows you to undo your edits if you did make a mistake. Redo undoes an
    undo operation. (Note that the number of possible undo operations is rather
    limited.)</p>

<h2>Clear</h2>

<p>
    By activating the Clear command, everything in the currently selected area
    of the map will be deleted. Unlike for the Cut command, the copy buffer
    remains unchanged.</p>

<h2>Cut</h2>

<p>
    By activating the Cut command, everything in the currently selected area of
    the map will be deleted and stored into the copy buffer.</p>

<h2>Copy</h2>

<p>
    By activating the Copy command, everything in the currently selected area is
    stored into the copy buffer. The map itself remains unchanged.</p>

<p>
    (Note that multi-part game objects will usually be copied only when their
    "head"-tile is located within the selected area. Since the position of this
    "head"-tile differs, expect some strange behavior there.)</p>

<h2>Paste</h2>

<p>
    The Paste command allows to dump the contents of the copy buffer onto the
    map. First, select a square on the map to be the top-left corner of the
    pasted area. Anything which doesn't fit within the borders of the map will
    not get pasted. Multi-part game objects which would reach outside of the map
    borders, and be it only with their small toe, don't get pasted either.</P>

<h2>Replace</h2>

<p>
    The Replace replaces (or deletes) game objects by the selection in the
    Object Chooser.</p>

<h2>Fill</h2>

<p>
    There are different fill commands:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fill Above: if the selected map square is not empty, insert the new game
        object above
    <li>Fill Below: if the selected map square is not empty, insert the new game
        object below
    <li>Random Fill Above: same as "Fill Above" but fills only a fraction of the
        selected map squares
    <li>Random Fill Below: same as "Fill Below" but fills only a fraction of the
        selected map squares
    <li>Flood fill: if the cursor is on an empty map square, fills the cursor
        map square and all adjacent empty map squares
</ul>
