<H1 align=center>Treasurelists producing multiple items</H1>

<P>You can recognize this type of treasurelist by the icon:
    <IMG SRC="treasure_list.png" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM">. Such a
    treasurelist can produce multiple items from the list. Objects with no
    chance set are always generated - Others are only generated when they
    succeed a random-roll at the given chance.</P>

<P>
    Look at the example below, the "giant" treasurelist:
    <br>
    Club, throwing skill and boulders will always be generated. Gold coins have
    a chance of 65% to be generated, and there is only a 10% chance that one
    item out of the giant_parts list is generated. Numbers like in "<b>80</b>
    goldcoin" indicate that if chance succeeds, a stack of 1-80 gold coins can
    appear.
</P>

<P>
    Note that chances of different items do not influence each other in any way.
    However, the YES/NO option allows to set dependencies between items. Look at
    the example below, the "goblin" treasurelist:
    <br>
    There is a 10% chance for the bow to be generated. Now <b>if</b> the bow is
    generated, automatically arrows are generated too.
    <br>
    There is a 5% chance for the sword to be generated. If that fails, the short
    sword has a 10% chance to be generated. If that fails again, there is a 15%
    chance for the dagger.
