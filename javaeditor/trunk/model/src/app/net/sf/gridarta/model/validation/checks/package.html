This package contains the checks for validating maps.
<h3>How to create your own checks</h3>

<p>The easiest way to create your own checks is this:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Extend {@link net.sf.gridarta.model.validation.AbstractValidator
        AbstractValidator} by a class named like
        net.sf.gridarta.map.validation.checks.MyMapChecker that additionally
        implements one of the {@link net.sf.gridarta.model.validation.Validator
        Validator} sub-interfaces
    </li>
    <li>Extend {@link net.sf.gridarta.model.validation.errors.ValidationError
        ValidationError} or one of its subclasses by a class named like <code>net.sf.gridarta.map.model.validation.checks.MyError</code>.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Note: to use the automatic localization feature, the error class and
    validator class must match name like the existing checkers.</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>If you extend {@link net.sf.gridarta.model.validation.AbstractValidator
    AbstractValidator} without actually really implementing one of the {@link
    net.sf.gridarta.model.validation.Validator Validator}, your validator will
    be a valid and compilable validator but also a dysfunctional stub. So don't
    forget to extend the corresponding sub-interface.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Do I really have to always extend {@link
        net.sf.gridarta.model.validation.errors.ValidationError ValidationError}
        for my validator's errors?
    </dt>
    <dd>Well not really. But the automatic localization of
        <code>ValidationError</code>s depends on separate error class names.
        Also, {@link net.sf.gridarta.model.validation.errors.CorrectableError
        CorrectableError} depends on separate error classes.
