<h1>Where should I start?</h1>

<p>Are you new to Crossfire map making? Do you plan to create a huge continent,
    a large city, or maybe an entire new world? You have plots in mind, epic
    stories and mystical places... - But you don't know where to start?</p>

<p>Don't worry, this is a common problem that all of us went through. My advice:
    <b>Start small</b>. Too many people have started to work on a huge map set,
    and they've never been able to complete it. At some point the interest was
    gone, finally the maps were forgotten and lost. What a pity! You wouldn't
    believe how often this has happened.</p>

<p>The other point is: You need to learn step by step. Crossfire map making
    requires quite a bit of learning. When you start with small and easy maps,
    working your way up later, this learning can be a joyful process.</p>

<h2>A recommended first "project"</h2>

<p>Look at the existing Crossfire maps. Search for a small map (like a house or
    a cave) which is really crappy designed and never played. There's quite a
    lot of those yet, unfortunately. So, take this map and re-create it from
    scratch. Make it look nice, choose monsters fitting into the place/area.
    According to your map making skills, you may even go so far as to add a
    little secret perhaps, an NPC, a story, or a small treasure - whatever you
    like. But better not all at once. Not yet.</p>

<p>You can finish your work in a few hours, or a day. Don't forget to test it,
    make sure everything works as expected. Now be proud, your first map is
    done! Send an email to the crossfire-maps list, or connect to the crossfire
    IRC channel (see <a href="http://crossfire.real-time.com/">http://crossfire.real-time.com/</a>)
    for details). Announce what you have created and ask someone to commit it to
    the Crossfire SVN repository. As long as your map is nice and harmless, rest
    assured that there is no problem to get that done.</p>

<p>Most online game servers update their maps from SVN regularly. Quite soon,
    your map will show up there. Players from all over the world are going to
    play it. Isn't that fascinating? :-)</p>

<h2>A recommended second "project"</h2>

<p>Now perhaps it's time to create something a little more complex, where you
    can let your inspirations run free. Create a small quest, involving like two
    or three maps. It could be a small tower, a castle or a little island.</p>

<p>This time you can decide whether to create all-new maps or again replace
    existing maps which are crappy. If you choose to add all-new maps, spend
    some time looking for a suitable place in the existing Crossfire world to
    link your maps in. Try to resist the temptation to link it to Scorn, unless
    it is a very low level map and you really don't find a better place.</p>

<p>Now think about a rough plot for your maps. There's no need to come up with
    an award-winning bestseller fantasy story (Save that one for later, hehe).
    You can choose a simple type of quest like: "fetch item A from monster B and
    bring it to place C in order to get a reward". Just try to create something
    with a little bit of flavor. Maybe sprinkle a small bit of story with
    magic_mouths, books or NPCs.</p>

<p>It is likely that already here you'll get to a point where you want to do
    something but don't know how. If something is too hard, maybe just do
    something else which is easier. Or ask for help on IRC or the crossfire-maps
    mailing list.</p>

<h2>Embarking on the big map set</h2>

<p>I recommend you work on a lot more small maps before you start working on a
    big set. Don't start unless you feel you have already acquired a good deal
    of map-making experience. Then, think about the amount of work you can and
    want to tackle. If it's too much, ask a friend to help you, or simply cut
    down on your goals.</p>

<p>Always keep in mind that it is not the size that makes a good map. It is the
    amount of work and thought invested.</p>
