On Screenshots
==============

To be really useful, please create screenshots in 1280x960 without window borders.
(If your OS / window manager doesn't support this, get yourself something better!)

Either yourself or somebody else should create the following versions:
* screeniename-orig.png     Original version as saved by screenshot tool (e.g. ksnapshot)
* screeniename-gimp.png     After saving it with gimp as progressive PNG with compression level 9
* screeniename-FM.png       Scaled to 800x600 progressive compression 9 PNG
* screeniename-SF.jpg       Scaled to 640x480 progressive compression 75% JPEG
