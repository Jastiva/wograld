<p>
    This document describes the history of the Gridarta project (newest to
    oldest). </p>

<h2>2006</h2>

<p>
    In 2006, Christian Hujer, Daniel Viegas (Daimonin) and Andreas Kirschbaum
    (CrossFire) decided that it would be a good idea to reunite the development
    effort of these two editors. They created "Gridarta" as a project for
    merging the two editors CFJavaEditor and DaimoninEditor into a single
    one. </p>

<p>
    The name "Gridarta" was chosen as a combination of the words "grid" and
    "art". It's an imitation of the original "Gridder" name. It's reminiscence
    of "Siddharta" is a nice coincidence. </p>

<h2>2005</h2>

<p>
    In 2005, Christian Hujer started lead maintenance of DaimoninEditor, adding
    numerous features. </p>

<h2>2002</h2>

<p>
    Since 2002, CFJavaEditor and DaimoninEditor were projects developed
    independently of each other. </p>

<p>
    In 2002, Michael Toennies created <a href="http://www.daimonin.net/">Daimonin</a>
    as an independent branch of CrossFire out of ISO-CrossFire, the version of
    CrossFire with isometric graphics. For Daimonin, CFJavaEditor became
    DaimoninEditor. </p>

<h2>2001</h2>

<p>
    In 2001, Andreas Vogl started maintaining CFJavaEditor, adding a lot of
    features. </p>

<h2>2000</h2>

<p>
    In 2000, Pasi Ker√§nen published
    <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/hosted/javanerd/gridder.asp">Gridder</a>, a
    simple level editor for 2D games. Based on Gridder, Michael Toennies created
    CFJavaEditor, a map editor for the popular MMORPG
    <a href="http://crossfire.real-time.com/">CrossFire</a>, which soon replaced
    the original crossedit application for editing maps for CrossFire. </p>
