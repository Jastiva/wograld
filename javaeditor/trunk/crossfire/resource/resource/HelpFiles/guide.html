            Of course you have total creative freedom at building your maps. But
            if you'd like to have your maps included in the official Crossfire
            distribution, you should keep the following "golden rules" in your
            mind. Actually it's more guidelines than rules. However, if you've
            played Crossfire for a while, I bet you'll find them quite
            reasonable anyways.

<H2 align=center>Guidelines for map-layout and -concept:</H2>

<UL>
    <LI>Pure hack'n'slash maps are boring. <B>Your maps should contain a
        storyline</B>, or at least a "theme". Put NPCs (non-player-characters),
        books and magic_mouths into your maps to present your stories.
    <LI><B>Places with high level monsters should not be easy to reach.</B> I
        know there are several maps breaking with this rule, but that doesn't
        mean it's okay. If you intend to use monsters like
        Jessies/Demonlords/Ancient Dragons, put them at the end of a quest, not
        at the beginning.
    <LI><B>Put secrets into your maps.</B> Places that can only be reached after
        investigating libraries, talking to NPCs and the likes. Make your maps
        non-linear. It is nice to have more than one way to solve a quest. Maybe
        one obvious way with brute fighting, and one clever way that needs more
        questing.
    <LI><B>Make sure that everything works as you intended</B>, especially check
        all your exit paths. Avoid one-way paths, trapping the player. And keep
        in mind - Maps do reset! Example: When a player disconnects behind an
        opened (formerly locked) door, he will be trapped when he rejoins the
        game later. Eventually place "emergency exits" for such cases.
    <LI><B>Motivate the player to use</B> as <B>many skills</B> as possible to
        solve your quests. Make him fight, think, disarm traps, cast spells, fly
        over pits, ... possibilities are great - make use of them.
    <LI><B>Treat the player in a fair way.</B> If you surprise him with instant
        death, he will hate your maps. A player should be aware of dangers, so
        that he has at least the *possibility* to react. Besides, don't plunge
        players into frustration. When you create puzzles, try to keep them at a
        level where they are solvable by mortal beings.
        <br>
        (That doesn't mean all puzzles have to be short and small, just
        "solvable".) Players could look at your maps via editor at any time.
        Don't force them doing this. Support the "honorable" players.
    <LI><B>Avoid mixing difficulty levels</B> all over the place. When newbie
        maps, mid level- and high level areas stay separated, players have a
        much easier time to find what is suitable for them. It is okay to place
        a harder map into a low level area, as long as it requires something to
        enter which keeps out too weak players.
</UL>
<H2 align=center>Guidelines for creating artifacts:</H2>

<UL>
    <LI><B>Don't rely on artifacts to make your maps interesting for
        players.</B>
    <LI>When you create a new artifact (weapon, armor, etc), <B>always keep an
        eye on play balance.</B> Powerful items must not be reachable without
        hard fighting AND questing. Look at other maps. Try to adopt the average
        taste of "difficulty". Make sure the artifact is always hard to get, not
        only for the first time. A hidden location, for instance, does not
        suffice.
    <LI><B>Every good artifact should have negative attributes as well.</B>
        There should be no "perfect set of equipment".
    <LI><B>Don't ruin existing quests</B> by inserting identical (or even
        better) items at easier places. There is enough room for new kinds of
        artifacts/treasure.
</UL>
