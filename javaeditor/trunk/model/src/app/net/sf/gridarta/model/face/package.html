The face is the appearance of an object.
<p/>
This package contains classes for managing icons in memory sensitive caches.
Currently, the keys to lookup the icons are Strings (usually the facename of an
archetype), and lookup is done in HashMaps.
<p/>
HashMaps are fast, but, of course, never as fast as an indexed array. Though,
HashMaps are easier to maintain. In case someone complains about the usage of
HashMaps instead of arrays in this package, I have documented my performance
considerations.
<dl>
    <dt>How fast is String hashCode generation?</dt>
    <dd>Extremely fast. Strings are often used as Hash keys, therefore a
        String's hash code is ached and only calculated the first time a it is
        queried. All subsequent invocations return the previously calculated,
        cached hash code.
    </dd>
    <dt>How fast is HashMap lookup compared with Array indexing?</dt>
    <dd>
        To index an Array gives a constant speed of <var>O[array] = O(c)</var>
        where <var>c</var> is the time it takes to address and offset. To lookup
        in a HashMap gives a performance of approximately <var>O[hashMap] =
        O(2*c + log2(n)*c*2)</var> where <var>n</var> is the number of HashMap
        entries. In general, a HashMap gives a very good performance, but not
        compared with an array when an index can be used.
    </dd>
    <dt>How does lookup scale?</dt>
    <dd>
        Lookup is used every time the code needs an image, which is nearly every
        time some painting is done by Java. Since maps are 2.5-dimensional
        structures, the lookup part of painting maps gives a general performance
        of <var>O[paintLookup] = O(O[lookup] * x * y * z)</var>. For a map with
        the size 24*24 and an average tile coverage of 2 faces requires 24*24*2
        lookups which is 1152 lookups. And let <var>n</var>, the number of
        HashMap entries, be 3688. If <var>O[lookup] == O[array]</var>, the
        performance is <var>O[paintLookup] = O(c * x * y * z) = O(c *
        1152)</var>. If <var>O[lookup] == O[hashMap]</var>, the performance is
        <var>O[paintLookup] = O((2*c + log2(n)*c*2) * x * y * z) = O((2*c +
            log2(3688)*c*2) * 1152) = O((2*c + 24*c) * 1152) = O(c *
            29952)</var> It is a realistic assumption that the number of
        effective cycles required for performing a lookup in Java is always
        smaller than 10 times the performance. That means, a complete map paint
        lookup for the given example map takes less than 300,000 cycles when
        using a HashMap. Current CPUs execute about 5,000,000,000 cycles per
        second.
    </dd>
    <dt>How often is lookup needed?</dt>
    <dd>
        Repainting is done when a new tile was painted, the map scrolls, a map
        was loaded, hidden or otherwise gets completely refreshed, an archetype
        panel scrolls or a pickmap is used. Lookup does not happen more than 2-3
        times per second, except for scrolling.
    </dd>
    <dt>Other considerations</dt>
    <dd>
        The design to generate artificial indices for faces has some flaws.
        Keeping several arrays in parallel to hold the same information can
        cause serious, eventually difficult to find bugs. Such a design also
        prevents the implementation of dynamic archetype handling, where arches
        and faces should be loadable, editable and un-loadable during editor
        runtime. The allocation of several large arrays also is a serious
        indicator for design flaws when using artificial indices, also these
        arrays need to be anxiously oversized to not get into
        ArrayIndexOutOfBounds trouble. The natural index of a face is its name,
        the object oriented index of a face is its own reference. Mapping face
        names to face references therefore is a good and clear design and very
        resistant against bugs or overflows.
        <p/>
        Also, an archetype first naturally comes with a face name. To get an
        index for a face name, it is required to first do a linear search.
        Linear search is always wrong and averages to <var>O(n * c)</var> which
        is worse than HashMap performance. If the indices are sorted, a binary
        search with a performance of <var>O(2*c + log2(n)*c*2)</var>, which is
        exactly what a HashMap does. That means, the term that best describes
        the usage of artificial face indices for increasing face lookup
        performance is "Augenauswischerei".
    </dd>
</dl>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Do not use the face number for face lookup, use the face name instead.
    </li>
    <li>Future: Refactor all code to eliminate artificial indices for faces and
        arches
    </li>
</ul>
