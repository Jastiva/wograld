    <title>Merging Map Editors</title>

<h2>About this document</h2>

<p>
    This document describes changes, dangers and ways about merging the map
    editors of the MMORPG projects Crossfire and Daimonin. </p>

<h3>Authors</h3>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    The MMORPG Daimonin split from Crossfire several years ago. At that time,
    Crossfire had a map editor, which was also split for Daimonin. Now,
    approximately 5 years after the split, the formats for maps and other game
    data still are quite similar. </p>

<p>
    What will probably stay in common for both projects for quite a long time is
    the game data architecture. The game data architecture mainly knows the
    following entities: </p>
<dl>
    <dt>Map</dt>
    <dd>A game map consists of map width Ã— map height map squares.</dd>
    <dt>Map Square</dt>
    <dd>A map square consists of zero or more arch object instances.</dd>
    <dt>Arch</dt>
    <dd>An arch is a prototype for arch object instances.</dd>
    <dt>Arch Object Instance</dt>
    <dd>An arch object instance is a game object.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Current Situation</h3>

<p>
    Currently, there exist two editors of interest: The Crossfire Java Editor
    and the Daimonin Editor, written in Java as well. The Crossfire Editor has
    some interesting features the Daimonin Editor does not yet have, most
    notably a scripting plugin for Python. The Daimonin Editor also has some
    interesting features the Crossfire Editor does not yet have, most notably
    performance, smaller footprint, cleaner code and design, a map validator and
    more editing possibilities. </p>

<h3>Technical ways of merging</h3>

<p>
    The following possibilities for merging exist: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Throwing away Daimonin Editor and using Crossfire Editor as a base.</li>
    <li>Throwing away Crossfire Editor and using Daimonin Editor as a base.</li>
    <li>Continuing both editors with the effort of assimilating each other until
        a state where not a single line of code differs, then spin off a new
        project for the editor.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The last possibility means the biggest effort of all, but has the advantage
    of not discriminating either editor and the chance of retaining all useful
    features of both editors. This document only discusses the last one of these
    possibilities. </p>

<h2>Realization</h2>

<h3>Future Code Base</h3>

<p>
    The following possibilities for future code bases exist: </p>

<ul>
    <li>A. Maintaining the editor within Crossfire.</li>
    <li>B. Maintaining the editor within Daimonin.</li>
    <li>
        C. Maintaining the editor within a project of its own, whilst
        <ul>
            <li>C.1 keeping the differences within each project,</li>
            <li>
                C.2 Keeping the differences with the editor project
                <ul>
                    <li>C.2.a not apart (means a X editor user will have to load
                        the Y specific parts as well),
                    </li>
                    <li>C.2.b in separate branches,</li>
                    <li>C.2.c in separate modules.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following persons have made statements about the possibilities: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Cher, voting for C.2.c</li>
    <li>Zergus, voting for C.2.c</li>
    <li>Ragnor and other editor developers: votes missing</li>
    <li>Project leaders / admins: votes missing</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to merge</h3>

<p>
    There are four possibilities for merging: </p>

<ul>
    <li>D. Using the Crossfire editor as base, merging the Daimonin specific
        parts into it.
    </li>
    <li>E. Using the Daimonin editor as base, merging the Crossfire specific
        parts into it.
    </li>
    <li>F. Developing both editors in separate modules or projects whilst
        assimilating each other, until a merge is easy.
    </li>
    <li>G. Creating a new editor from the scratch, assimilating parts of the old
        editors.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following persons have made statements about the possibilities: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Cher, definitely declining D. and E., but unsure whether to do F. or G..
    </li>
    <li>Ragnor, zergus and other editor developers: votes missing</li>
    <li>Project leaders / admins: votes missing</li>
</ul>
