This package contains the framework for validating maps.
<h2>Design Notes</h2>

<h3>Notes on not using a Mirror API</h3>
Although it would have been possible to create a Mirror API I have decided to
directly hand out the original API to the map validation.
<h4>Pro Mirror API / Contra Original API</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Keep the validation from (accidental) manipulation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pro Original API / Contra Mirror API</h4>

<ul>
    <li>The amount of work that a mirror API would have involved.</li>
    <li>Allow the validation to provide an error correction facility.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes on the class model</h3>
It would also have been possible to create less classes. But then the handling
of enabling / disabling individual checks would have required more coding. I
believe that this model is the best balance between an API that is powerful,
small and easy to use. The number of classes is a bit high but all classes are
extremely small.
