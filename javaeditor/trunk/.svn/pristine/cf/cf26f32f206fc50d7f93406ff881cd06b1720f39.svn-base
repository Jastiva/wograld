<h1>Pickmaps</h1>

<p>On the left side in the editor, there is the list of archetypes, as well as
    the pickmaps. In case you haven't seen them yet, click on the "Pickmaps"
    panel to take a look at the pickmaps.</p>

<p>In contrast to the list of archetypes, pickmaps offer a compact and more
    dynamic palette of objects. Left-click on a pickmap to select an object that
    you see. Then you can insert copies of this object to the map by
    right-clicking on the map view.</p>

<h2>Selecting an game object to insert</h2>

<p>There are different ways to select game object(s) from pickmaps:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Exactly one selected game object: inserts this game object
    <li>Multiple selected game objects: inserts a random game object from the
        selection
    <li>No selected game objects: inserts a random game object from all game
        objects in the pickmap
</ul>

<h2>Modifying a pickmap</h2>

<p>The cool thing is that it also works in the opposite way: Left-click on the
    Map View to select an object, then right click on the <i>pickmap</i> to copy
    it there. All special object settings will be copied along. Pickmaps are
    only allowed to store one object per square however, so inserting will fail
    on squares which are already occupied. No problem though, because you can
    also delete from the pickmaps with middle-click (Just like you do it on
    normal maps).</p>

<p>So, the pickmaps are more than just a fixed palette of objects. Probably
    you've seen that there's also a "Pickmaps" menu. There you find commands to
    save pickmaps, revert them to last saved state, or close them. If you modify
    pickmaps and don't save them, the changes will be lost after closing the
    editor.</p>

<p>The menu command "Pickmaps->Open Active Pickmap as Map" opens a new Map View
    for the active pickmap. When you save this map, the changes are reflected
    back into the pickmap.</p>

<p>It might be helpful to shape and modify your pickmaps, nevertheless you might
    come to a point where you are quite satisfied with their look. In that case
    you might find it useful to "lock" them with menu command "Pickmaps->Lock
    All Pickmaps". This will disable any further changes to the pickmaps unless
    they become unlocked again. In that way, you prevent to accidentally mess
    something up by clicking the wrong mouse button.</p>
