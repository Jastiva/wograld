The file JAPI.xml contains the recommended inspection settings for IntelliJ IDEA.
The file is named JAPI.xml because the Daimonin Editor uses the same code style as JAPI (http://japi.sourceforge.net/).
To use it, copy it to the Inspections directory of your local per-user IntelliJ IDEA installation and restart IntelliJ IDEA.
