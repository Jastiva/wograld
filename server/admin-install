Installation Instructions

Fresh Install

for the server:
1)  Create a source directory under "home".  
    Drop all files from the server CVS folder, or the
    zip file, into here. "/home/wograld" or whatever you want
 
2)  You should use the new arches from CVS.  "arch"  arch has a subfolder "arch" in it.
Put this subfolder and its contents into the server/lib directory. See that there is a long list of ".png" and ".arc"
    in several subfolders under /lib/arch.  

3) Make sure you are in the directory "/home/wograld"/server 
   At the command prompt on your terminal type
    ./configure
    then type
    make
    then log into root mode or sudo
    make install
    To run your server set your directory to "/home/wograld"/server/server and type:
    ./wograld
    
    This is commonly known as Configure, make, make install and is used for compiling many software programs.

4)  If it compiled, it should be installed in
    /usr/games/wograld/bin or /usr/games/wograld/bin

5)  Go to /usr/games/wograld/share/wograld
    if there isn't a "maps" subfolder, it needs to be
    created.

6)  The maps can be downloaded from
    CVS "maps" or from	 
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/wograld/files

7)  Put these files into /usr/games/wograld/share/wograld/maps

8) Go to "/usr/games/wograld/bin".  Type "./wograld"
    or "./wograld" to start the server.

Getting the client

1) get the client from the CVS "javaclient"

2) put it into a "home/wograld/javaclient" folder

3) this is a Java program and uses Ant to build
	you may need to download javac and jre

4) you may need to download Ant

5) from home/wograld/javaclient/javaclient/trunk,
	there should be a build.xml, if you are in the correct folder.
	if there is an existing jxclient.jar, delete jxclient.jar.	
	type ant to build
	there should be a file jxclient.jar produced
6) type "java -jar jxclient.jar" to launch the client

7) run the local server with cd "/home/wograld/server/","./wograld" if it is not running,
	and if you want to play locally 
8) in "/home/wograld/javaclient/javaclient/" type "java -jar jxclient.jar" to launch the client
9) connect to localhost to play locally, or select another server.
   standard crossfire servers are not listed.

If you want to try the deprecated X11 client 

1)You will want to have a working client, preferably the new one.
    Get the client source from CVS "client"

2) Put it into a "home/wograld-client" folder.
    Make sure you are in the "home/wograld"/client directory
     ./configure
    Now set your directory to "home/wograld"/client/x11 
      make
      Make yourself a super user then type:	 
      make install

3) Sound effects also need to be downloaded separately.
    The game is playable without it, but it may print an error
    message. Get them at 
    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13833
   under crossfire client sounds 1.9.1 

4) Go to the "home/wograld-client" folder.  There should be
    a folder called "sound-src".  Put the "sounds" from this
    download into it.

5) Go to "home/wograld-client/x11" and run "./wogclnt"
    This client should be working. I do not have the other
    client up to date yet:  "home/wograld-client/gtk/gwogclnt" 

If you want to install a metserver:

TODO

You do not need to run one to connect a client to localhost, the menu looks similar on client
If you want to run one, LAMP stack is desired, although other servers may be possible
Do not try to use crossfire.real-time.com to index your server or search for servers,
the protocols are different

If you want to install the Java Map Editor:

at a later time, hopefully, this can be merged to Gridarta

1) get the editor from the CVS "javaeditor"

2) put it into a "/home/wograld/javaeditor" folder

3) you need javac, jre, ant

4) go to "/home/wograld/javaeditor/trunk/"
	remove CrossfireEditor.jar if it is present
	type ant to build
	run with "java -jar CrossfireEditor.jar"
	to operate the editor, manuals from gridarta are useful

If you want to install or use the legacy crossedit:

this is present in the server files
it is deprecated, has dependencies of xaw and libpng,
it is not recommended
   
Administration Instructions

Changing the artwork

to add new graphics, 
1)  You should use the new arches from CVS.  "arch"
2)  Put the files into "/home/wograld"/lib/arch/.
3) Go to "/home/wograld"/lib/ and type "make collect".
    This does some parsing of ".png" and ".arc" to create
    files for monsters and other objects.


4) Go to "/usr/games/wograld/share/wograld" and back up the
    files for animations,archetypes,bmaps,bmaps.paths,wograld.0,
    wograld.1,wograld.2,faces,smooth.
5) Return to "home/wograld"/lib.  Copy
	animations,archetypes,bmaps,bmaps.paths,wograld.0,
    wograld.1,wograld.2,faces,smooth into 
    "/usr/games/wograld/share/wograld"
6) go to the "/home/wograld"/server/lib/arch folder, and copy the treasures file into /usr/games/wograld/share/wograld folder;
	for now do not use the one produced from "make collect"

Changing the code  

1) drop all the files into /home/wograld or whereever you put it.
2)  ./configure  make    make install
