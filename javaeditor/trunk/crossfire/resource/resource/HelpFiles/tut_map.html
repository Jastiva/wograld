<H1 align=center>Basics for designing a map</H1>

<p>
    Once you have opened a map, you can start to shape and modify it. You can do
    the following actions with your mouse:</p>

<ul>
    <li>left mouse button: <a href="#select">select game object(s)</a>
    <li>right mouse button: <a href="#insert">insert an game object</a>
    <li>middle mouse button: <a href="#delete">delete an game object</a>
</ul>

<h2><a name="select">Selecting game object</a></h2>

<P>
    To select a game object, left click on it. You can do so either on the Map
    View or in the Selected Square Display to the right. If you want to select a
    group of squares on the map (e.g. for copy/paste actions), left click and
    drag. You will notice a rectangular area getting highlighted as you
    drag.</P>

<h2><a name="insert">Inserting game objects</a></h2>

<P>
    To insert a new game object, you must first select one in the Object Chooser
    to the left. Right click to insert the selected game object into the map.
    You can also right-click into the Selected Square Display in order to insert
    the game object at a specific place in a pile of game objects. You can drag
    the mouse on the Map View in order to insert the same game object on many
    map squares.</P>

<P>
    To insert into the <B>inventory</B> of a game object (often needed for
    containers and monsters), proceed as follows:
    <br>
    In the Object Chooser, select the object you want to insert. On the Map View
    or Selected Square Display, select (highlight) the target game object that
    you want to insert into. Press the "Add Inv" button to insert.
</P>

<P>
    There is a convenience function for inserting walls into a map: The "<B>auto
    joining</B>"-feature. Activate the checkbox in the menu "Map->Autojoin" to
    enable it. Whenever you insert or delete a wall now, any walls of the same
    type will automatically join to form a continuous solid wall. This saves you
    the hassle of switching between all the different wall archetypes.</P>

<h2><a name="delete">Deleting game objects</a></h2>

<P>
    To delete a game object, simply middle click on it. You can drag the mouse
    to delete multiple game objects. Deleting specific game objects out of a
    stack is possible by middle-clicking in the Selected Square Display.</P>
