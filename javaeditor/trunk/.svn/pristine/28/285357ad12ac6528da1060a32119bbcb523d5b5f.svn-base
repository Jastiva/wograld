<h1>Modifying the map properties</h1>

<p>Every map has "global properties": Reset time settings, map text, etc. These
    can be viewed and modified by selecting menu "Map->Map Properties".</p>

<h2><a name="properties">Map properties tab</a></h2>

This tab contains general properties of the map.

<p><b>Name:</b> The in-game map name as the player sees it. It can be viewed
    with the Crossfire command "mapinfo".</p>

<p><b>Region:</b> The in-game region name of this map. It can be viewed with the
    Crossfire command "mapinfo".</p>

<p><b>Width, Height:</b> The map size in tiles. You can resize the map by
    entering a new value. Selecting a larger map size inserts empty map squares
    to the right and/or bottom; selecting a smaller map size cuts off a part
    from the right and/or bottom.</p>

<p><b>Unique map:</b> If set, this entire map is unique. Exactly unique to what
    will depend on how it is used (It could be a per player unique map, or maybe
    a common map that is just permanent for all the players). Generally,
    "unique" means the map never loses its state when it resets.</p>

<p><b>Outdoor map:</b> This is a very important attribute. It must be set for
    all outdoor maps. An outdoor map is a map which is not meant to have a
    "ceiling" of any kind. If your map contains grass and trees or rocks and
    hills, it is most likely an outdoor map and you should set this flag.</p>

<p><b>Fixed reset:</b> If enabled, the map reset countdown will not start over
    when someone enters the map. Thus, once the map has been loaded, it will
    reset in after <a href="#parameters">"Reset Timeout"</a> seconds, no matter
    what access happens. This is very useful for shops and towns which are
    constantly accessed, but should be reset periodically.</p>

<p><b>Nosmooth map:</B> If enabled, no faces in this map will be smoothed.</p>

<h2><a name="description">Description tab</a></h2>

<p>This textfield is meant to contain the map creator's name, and the date when
    the map was created or last modified. If you are planning to publish your
    maps on the net or get them into the official Crossfire distribution then
    <b>please write your name into that textfield for every map you create</b>.
    This information with shown in the Crossfire "mapinfo" command.</p>

<h2><a name="lore">Lore tab</a></h2>

<p>If your map has some kind of "lore" attached to it, you should add it
    here.</p>

<h2><a name="parameters">Parameters tab</a></h2>

<p><b>Enter X, Y:</b> These values represent the location where players get
    inserted if entering through an exit that has no destination coordinates
    set. Usage of this functionality is <b>not advisable</b>. It might even
    happen that these attributes get removed in future.</p>

<p><b>Difficulty:</b> This value stores the map difficulty. If set to zero, the
    server code will try to come up with a reasonable difficulty value.</p>

<p><b>Darkness:</b> Light/darkness of the map (overall). If 0, all of the map is
    fully bright. Maximum darkness is 5.</p>

<p><b>Swap time:</b>: This controls how many ticks must elapse after the map has
    not been used before it gets swapped out. Swapping out is different than
    reset, as a swapped out map will get loaded back into memory if someone
    re-visits it before it is reset. Zero means the server takes a certain
    default value.</p>

<p>Don't modify this value unless you know exactly what you're doing.</p>

<p><b>Reset timeout:</b> Stores the number of seconds that need to elapse before
    this map will be reset. For instance, if set to 1800, the map expires after
    30 minutes. If set to zero, a default value is applied.</p>

<h2><a name="shop">Shop tab</a></h2>

This tab specifies parameters for shopkeeper.

<p><b>Shop type:</b> This field specifies which items the shop trades in. It is
    a semicolon delimited list of item types and values. For a potion shop it
    might be
<pre>
potion:95;*:-80
</pre>
This example means that the shop is interested in "potion"s (with a value of
95%) and not interested in any other item (with a value of -80%).</p>

<p><b>Greed:</b> Specifies how greedy the shopkeeper is. It is a multiplier on
    all prices offered. Items brought from the player are done so at a price
    divided by the greed; items sold to a player are overcharged by a factor of
    shopgreed.</p>

<p><b>Upper price limit:</b> The shopkeeper will not like items that are more
    value than this limit. It does not mean the shopkeeper will not buy such
    item; he just will not pay well. The price is given in silver coins.</p>

<p><b>Lower price limit:</b> The shopkeeper will not buy items that are less
    value than this limit. The price is given in silver coins.</p>

<p><b>Race:</b> Specifies the player race the shopkeeper likes. If set, the
    shopkeeper offers only 80% for players <em>not</em> matching.</p>

<h2><a name="weather">Weather tab</a></h2>

<p>This tab contains weather related settings. All values are just base values
    and will be modified by the weather code. Also, the settings only affect
    "world" maps.</p>

<p><b>These attributes are yet not fully implemented. Please use them only when
    you know exactly how they work!</b></p>

<p><b>Temperature:</b> Specifies the overall temperature of the map.</p>

<p><b>Pressure:</b> Specifies the overall pressure of the map.</p>

<p><b>Humidity:</b> Specifies the overall humidity of the map.</p>

<p><b>Wind speed:</b> Specifies the overall wind speed of the map.</p>

<p><b>Wind direction:</b> Specifies the overall wind direction of the map. It
    should be a value between 1 and 8.</p>

<p><b>Sky setting:</b> ???</p>

<h2><a name="map_tiles">Map tiles tab</a></h2>

<p>These entries determine what map is tiled in that direction. Map tiling is a
    feature that lets multiple maps be connected, effectively forming a much
    larger single map. This is most useful for the outdoor world maps, where it
    is not practical to have one massive map, but the old style tiling
    method.</p>
