<P><B>Where can I get the latest version of the Crossfire Editor?</B></P>

<P>The best source for a binary release is
    <A href="http://www.eracc.com/files/crossfire/">http://www.eracc.com/files/crossfire/</A>.
    You need the file "CrossfireEditor.jar". If you are interested in the latest
    changes, check out "ChangeLog".</P>

<P>Daily builds of the latest SVN version are available from
    <A href="http://crossfire.ailesse.com/">http://crossfire.ailesse.com/</A>.
</P>

<P>Another good (and the most up-to-date) source is Gridarta's SVN repository.
    You find it on the project homepage at
    <A href="http://gridarta.sourceforge.net/">http://gridarta.sourceforge.net/</A>.
    Try to figure out how to do an anonymous SVN checkout, then follow the
    instructions in the file "crossfire/INSTALL.txt".</P>

<P>For historical interest,
    <A href="http://mids.student.utwente.nl/~avogl/CFJavaEditor">http://mids.student.utwente.nl/~avogl/CFJavaEditor</A>
    is the personal page of the developer of CFJavaEditor (which the Crossfire
    Editor is based on).</P>

<P><B>The editor has successfully loaded the arches, but all the images are
    missing. WTF?</B></P>

<P>If you are using up-to-date Crossfire arches, these support multiple image
    sets. Select menu "File->Options" and make sure the entry "Use Image Set" is
    set to "Base". If you are using old arches, or iso arches, make sure the
    entry "Use Image Set" is set to "Disabled". If your settings were wrong then
    restart the editor after correction.</P>

<P><B>My CPU is too slow for this program, and my memory doesn't suffice... and
    my display has only 256 colors. What can I do?</B></P>

<P>Let's see... Buy a new computer? :-)
    <br>
    Now seriously, I'm sorry that this program requires a certain level of
    system performance - But I can't help it. I have invested big amounts of
    time to make everything run as fast as possible and with least Memory
    consumption.
</P>

<P><B>I found a bug. Where can I report it?</B></P>

<P>Add it to
    <A href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=166996&atid=841182">Gridarta's
        bug tracker</A> on the project homepage. To enable us to fix the bug, be
    sure to at least</P>

<UL>
    <LI>set the Category to "crossfire editor",
    <LI>include the application version (as found in Help|About),
    <LI>describe what is not working (including what you think is the correct
        behavior), and
    <LI>describe what we have to do to make the bug happen.
</UL>

<P><B>The editor is missing a useful feature. Can you add it?</B></P>

<P>Report it to the
    <A href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=166996&atid=841185">feature
        tracker on the project homepage</A>.</P>
