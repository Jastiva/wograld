<h1>Manipulating game objects</h1>

<p>Simple maps can be created just by using the archetypes from the Archetype
    Chooser. Though, if you want to create real cool maps, you will need to
    modify these objects very often, to suit your needs.</p>

<p>The object's in-game appearance and functionality is defined by many
    different attributes (object-type, name, resistances, ... etc). If you want
    to change the attributes of an object, you have two options:</p>

<p>

<ol>
    <li><p><b>Use the convenient attribute interface</b></p>

        <p>Select the game object you want to modify, then double click on it in
            the <a href="tut_frames.html">Selected Square Display</a> (on the
            right side). You could alternatively select it and press the
            "Attributes" button on the <a href="tut_frames.html">Game Object
                Attributes Panel</a>. A popup window will appear, containing all
            object attributes in a graphical user interface.</p>

    Game Object Attributes Dialog" title="The Game Object Attributes
    Dialog"></p>

    <li><p><b>Modify the archetype text directly</b></p>

        <p>Select the game object you want, then modify the attributes directly
            in the <a href="tut_frames.html">Game Object Text Editor</a> (in the
            bottom-right corner). Press the apply button when done, all
            customized lines will be printed in blue.</p>

        <p>But beware! You need to know exactly what you are doing there. If you
            do typing mistakes or set otherwise wrong values, you won't receive
            a warning. Modifying the archetype text directly is only recommended
            for experienced mapmakers.</p>
