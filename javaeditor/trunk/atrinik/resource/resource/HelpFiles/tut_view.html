<H1 align=center>The View Settings</H1>

<P>
    Under the View-menu, you'll find three types of view settings:</P>

<ol>
    <LI>the layout settings
    <LI>an option to change font
    <LI>the map settings
</ol>

<P>
    With the <B>layout setting</B> (Metal/CDE/Windows) you can change the
    overall look and feel of the editor. Personally I prefer the Metal-style,
    but I'm not sure if anyone cares... :-p</P>

<P>The <B>change font</B> panel allows you to adjust the font size and -style
    applying for the entire editor. (Note that some stuff, like the HTML help
    pages or window sizes are really hard to adjust. Therefore these obey mainly
    two font sizes: less or equal 12 pt and greater than 12 pt.) Which fonts
    look good varies greatly from system to system. The default font usually
    isn't the worst choice.</P>

<P>The <B>map view settings</B> are a nifty feature that allows you to select
    which types of objects you want to see & modify. For instance, if you select
    "Show Monsters" and "Show Walls", the map view will display only that:
    monsters and walls. Even copy/paste actions will ignore all objects which do
    not match the active view settings.
    <br>
    This feature can be used to detect disguised exits, connected objects and
    more. You can also use it, for example, to copy objects without their
    background tiles.
</P>

<P>
    Unfortunately, the map view settings require pretty extensive calculations
    when applied for the first time. So, if you have several large maps opened,
    expect to wait a short moment after applying a new view setting.</P>
