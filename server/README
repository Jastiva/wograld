WHAT IS WOGRALD?

  This is a multiplayer graphical arcade and adventure game made for
  the X-Windows environment. But soon we hope to have a
  Java client ready to run on all the major platforms that
  support Java.  It runs on a client/server model.
  The client runs with X11, has a broke GTK version that was never updated,
 or another never been modified for wograld SDL within a gtk window.  
 A java client is under development.

  Right now it has certain flavours from other games, especially Gauntlet (TM)
  and Nethack/Moria.  Really, we want it to resemble games such as Ultima
Online and Runescape more closely since thesse are more popular games that
ordinary users will love. 

  Any number of players can move around in their own window, finding
  and using items and battle monsters.  They can choose to cooperate
  or compete in the same "world".

REQUIREMENTS

  For UNIX, X-windows and an ANSI C compiler to compile this game.
  A window system is not needed if you don't want to compile the
  map editor.

  For Windows 9x, you need Visual C++ (or some other ANSI C
  compiler that can read ".dsw"-files). (no idea if this works with wograld)
  
COMPILING

  Wograld has been known to compile on a wide variety of
  systems.  It should compile and most all ANSI C and Posix
  compliant systems.

  To get directions on compilation for UNIX/LINUX,read the install below
 or read the admin-install file in the 
server folder.  No idea how, or if it can be gotten to work on windows.
  For Win9x, read INSTALL_WIN32.txt.

INSTALL

Installation Instructions

Fresh Install

for the server:
1)  Create a source directory under "home".  
    Drop all files from the server CVS folder, or the
    zip file, into here. "/home/wograld" or whatever you want
 
2)  You should use the new arches from CVS.  "arch"  arch has a subfolder "arch" in it.
Put this subfolder and its contents into the server/lib directory. See that there is a long list of ".png" and ".arc"
    in several subfolders under /lib/arch.  (the pre-alph 0.0.1 release already has this step done)

3) Make sure you are in the directory "/home/wograld"/server 
   At the command prompt on your terminal type
    ./configure
    then type
    make
    then log into root mode or sudo
    make install
    To run your server set your directory to "/home/wograld"/server/server and type:
    ./wograld
    
    This is commonly known as Configure, make, make install and is used for compiling many software programs.

4)  If it compiled, it should be installed in
    /usr/games/wograld/bin or /usr/games/wograld/bin

5)  Go to /usr/games/wograld/share/wograld
    if there isn't a "maps" subfolder, it needs to be
    created.

6)  The maps can be downloaded from 
    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13833
    "maps" if you do not have them. (crossfire version 1.9.1)

7)  Put these files into /usr/games/wograld/share/wograld/maps


8) if wograld.2 is missing copy it from the server/lib folder into the /usr/games/wograld/share/wograld
folder.

9) go to the "/home/wograld"/server/lib/arch folder, and copy the treasures file into /usr/games/wograld/share/wograld folder 

10) Go to "/usr/games/wograld/bin".  Type "./wograld"
    or "./wograld" to start the server.

11) For now, run server as root, there are certain folders that need premissions for the saving of maps and players.
I will figure out what premissions need to be changed later. (TODO)

Getting the client

1)You will want to have a working client, preferably the new one.
    Get the client source from CVS "client"

2) Put it into a "home/wograld-client" folder.
    Make sure you are in the "home/wograld"/client directory
     ./configure
    Now set your directory to "home/wograld"/client/x11 
      make
      Make yourself a super user then type:	 
      make install

3) Sound effects also need to be downloaded separately.
    The game is playable without it, but it may print an error
    message. Get them at 
    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13833
   under crossfire client sounds 1.9.1 

4) Go to the "home/wograld-client" folder.  There should be
    a folder called "sound-src".  Put the "sounds" from this
    download into it.

5) Go to "home/wograld-client/x11" and run "./wogclnt"
    This client should be working. I do not have the other
    client up to date yet:  "home/wograld-client/gtk/gwogclnt" 

    
Administration Instructions

Changing the artwork

to add new graphics, 
1)  You should use the new arches from CVS.  "arch"
2)  Put the files into "/home/wograld"/lib/arch/.
3) Go to "/home/wograld"/lib/ and type "make collect".
    This does some parsing of ".png" and ".arc" to create
    files for monsters and other objects.


4) Go to "/usr/games/wograld/share/wograld" and back up the
    files for animations,archetypes,bmaps,bmaps.paths,wograld.0,
    wograld.1,wograld.2,faces,smooth.
5) Return to "home/wograld"/lib.  Copy
	animations,archetypes,bmaps,bmaps.paths,wograld.0,
    wograld.1,wograld.2,faces,smooth into 
    "/usr/games/wograld/share/wograld"
6) go to the "/home/wograld"/server/lib/arch folder, and copy the treasures file into /usr/games/wograld/share/wograld folder;
	for now do not use the one produced from "make collect"

Changing the code  

1) drop all the files into /home/wograld or whereever you put it.
2)  ./configure  make    make install

USAGE

  Wograld runs on a client/server model.  You will also need the
  client to play.  You can either connect to a server someone else
  has set up, or run your own server and connect to that.  The
  client package has information for connecting to servers.

  To run your own server, you need to make the wograld binaries and install
  them, and then run the wograld program.  This now creates a server which
  you/other people can connect to.  The map files will need to get downloaded
  and installed for the server to run properly.  The maps should be
  unpacked in the $(TARGET)/share/wograld directory - after unpacking,
  you should have a $(TARGET)/share/wograld/maps directory.

  If you plan to run a long term server, you should use one of the scripts
  provided that will re-run wograld if it dies for some reason.

WEB SITES:

  The following web addresses have wograld information that you may find
  useful:

  http://www.wograld.org/
  is the main wograld site.


REPORTING BUGS

  First, check the INSTALL file  and the admin-install for common problems, and see if yours is
  mentioned.

  Bugs should be filed at the sourceforge web site:
        http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=184075&atid=907801

  When reporting bugs, make sure you include the following:
  o If you have a sourceforge login, make sure you are logged in.  In this
    way, if there are questions about the bug, you will be notified about
    the request for more information.
  o What version of wograld did you use?
  o What type of computer did you use (CPU type)
  o What is the version of the OS (ie Debian testing, fedora core 16 etc) ?
  o What windowing system are you using (Ie, openwindows, X11R6, etc)
  o What compiler (and its version) did you use (ie, gcc, acc, etc)?
  o Which flags did you give it?
  o If the bug happens when compiling wograld, send an EXACT copy of
    the compiler line, as well as the errors it puts out.  Sending bugs
    of the sort 'it failed with a line like ...' doesn't help any.
  o If the bug happened while running wograld:
    - Include any output before to the bug.
    - Give a description of what you did before the bug occured.  The better
	detailed the description, the better chance I have of figuring
	out where the bug happened, or how I can recreate the bug.
    - If possible, a stack trace from gdb (or other debugger) is very
      helpful.

The more information provided, the better chance of the bug being fixed in
a timely fashion.

Further debugging informatiion can be found at
http://crossfire.real-time.com/debugging_tips.html

SUBMITTING PATCHES:  See the doc/programming_guide file.
   The patches should be submitted to the patch tracker on sourceforge:
        http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=184075&atid=907803

PUBLIC SERVERS:

The best way to find a server to play is to run the client.  It will contact
the metaserver and present a list to choose from.  Unfortunatly, we do not have
a metaserver for wograld up yet.
