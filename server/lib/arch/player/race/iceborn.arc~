These creatures have been living under the arktic icecap for
millennia, but the global warming is destroying their habitat.
Therefore the Iceborns have gone to warmer areas, trying to adapt
and to find food in these regions. Ever since they have come here,
they have been aggressive and impulsive, feeling hurt for having
lost their home. As all elementals, the Iceborn is very magical
but physically weak.
