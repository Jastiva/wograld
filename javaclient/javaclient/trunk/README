Project description:
--------------------
jwogclnt is a java client for wograld (http://www.wograld.org).

Requires:
---------
- Sun JVM 1.6.x or higher; or Open JDK 6 or higher;
- At least 384MB of memory;

Recommended:
------------
- Sun JVM 1.6.0 or higher;
- Driver-level support for hardware accelerated operations
  (Either OpenGL or DirectX, depending on your system).

Fullscreen support:
-------------------
JXClient uses the fullscreen support provided by the JVM.

Although the client will switch to windowed mode if real fullscreen is not
available, it is important to note that accelerated support will probably end up
being disabled.

You can download an updated version from either http://www.java.com
or from http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp .

To check if the graphical operations are accelerated, you can add
"-Dsun.java2d.trace=log,timestamp,count,out:java2d.log" to your JVM command
line, run the client, then check the content of java2d.log.

Compiling the sources:
----------------------
Install Ant on your system; be sure to install the optional tasks as well. Make
sure both the JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME environment variables are set correctly.

Change into the jxclient directory. On the console type "ant" - that's all. Run
the client with "java -jar jxclient.jar".

Adding new music:
-----------------

1) In the javaclient, subfolder trunk/resource/music/
   Has a list of existing *.ogg files.  A new map for local hosting or
   to submit to the main project, can refer to any of these or to a new track
   You can add a new ogg file here if you want to.
   It is not likely that a remote server will choose it unless you submit
   the required files and they are accepted

2) In a map file, look for the keyword "background_music" in the map header
   that is, as part of the "arch map".  This can be changed from the map editor
   or from the text editor.  If no "background_music" keyword is found by the
   server, it will choose a default music track. If you add a new music track
   to the javaclient resouces then you can use its name as the key value

3) In the javaclient, if you add a music track that was not there before,
   go to the folder 
   trunk/src/jxclient/com/realtime/wograld/jxclient/server/wograld/
   and backup the file DefaultWograldServerConnection.java
   Then open the original file, and go to the method "processMusic()".
   Find the statements "if track==1".
   Then add a new case with the new track name.
   Write down the case number, as the server code needs to know this.

4) Go to the javaclient "trunk" folder and try to build using "ant".
   If build is successful, proceed to the next step, else check syntax.
   It will probably build even if the track name is incorrect, so verify.

5) Go to the server "common/" folder and back up the file "map.c".
   as a non .c file.  Find the function "load_map_header()"
   and find the keyword "background_music".
   Add a case, using the new number from step 3, for the track name.
   The track name should match that in the map file.


Connecting through a proxy:
---------------------------
Set an HTTP proxy to allow metaserver access to retrieve the list of available
game servers:

    java -Dhttp.proxyHost=proxy.hostname and -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 -jar jxclient.jar

or, alternatively,

    export http_proxy=http://proxy.hostname:8080/
    java -jar jxclient.jar

Set a SOCKS proxy for connection to game servers:

    java -DsocksProxyHost=proxy.hostname -DsocksProxyPort=1080 -jar jxclient.jar
