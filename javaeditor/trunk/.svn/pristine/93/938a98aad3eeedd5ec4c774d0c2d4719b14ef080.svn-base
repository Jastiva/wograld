<H1 align="center">Creating a basic map in the Crossfire Editor</H1>

<H2 align="center">Step 1 - Create a new empty map:</H2>

<P>Select menu "File->New", or click on the toolbar icon:
    <IMG SRC="map1_new.png" WIDTH="19" HEIGHT="18">

    <br>
    A popup window appears, where you can enter file name, map name and map
    size. The "map name" should be a descriptive name for what the map contains.
    It can be read by players in the game. Write something like "small house",
    "forest", "dark cave". The illustrated examples will show a very small map,
    for practical reasons. Of course you can make a bigger map than that.

<H2 align="center">Step 2 - Floor:</H2>

<P>Now it's time to put some floor tiles on your map. Look at the
    <A HREF="tut_frames.html">Default-Archetype panel</A> on the left side.
    These are the default objects you can choose from. Click on the "Pickmaps"
    tab and "background". Now left-click on one of the floors you like, and then
    right-click on the map to insert. (Middle-click to delete misplaced
    objects.)</P>

</P>

<H2 align="center">Step 3 - Walls:</H2>

<P>Let's add some walls next. On the <A HREF="tut_frames.html">Default-Archetype
    panel</A> (left side) select "Arch List" - "wall". Now pick one of the wall
    types. You can enable the menu "Map->Auto-Joining". This will automatically
    join the wall parts as you insert them on the map. Later you can switch off
    Auto-Joining again and replace some wall parts with special parts, like a
    window as seen below.</P>

<H2 align="center">Step 4 - Decorations:</H2>

<P>The basic structure is done, but it looks empty and boring. Let's add some
    decoration: A few furniture maybe, a barrel/statue/brazier or whatever is
    fitting. Different types of maps need different style of decoration of
    course. An undead map could show some tombstones/mist, pillars belong in a
    castle, altars in a church, trees/bushes for outdoor maps etc. (At this
    point I assume you know how to find things in the <A HREF="tut_frames.html">Default-Archetype
        panel</A>.)
    <br>
    You can place some doors between separate rooms. And maybe add a little
    food, because players are always hungry.

<H2 align="center">Step 5 - Monsters and Treasure:</H2>

<P>Okay, now the map looks nice - yet there is nothing a player can really do on
    this map (except for eating the food). If the map is supposed to be a
    dungeon, there have to be monsters. Let's insert some monsters and
    eventually some generators too.</P>
