<H1 align=center>Manipulating Objects</H1>

<P> Simple maps can be created just by using the default objects from the
    left-side window. Though, if you want to create real cool maps, you will
    need to modify these objects very often, to suit your needs.</P>

<P>The object's in-game appearance and functionality is defined by many
    different attributes (object-type, name, resistances, ... etc). If you want
    to change the attributes of an object, you have two options:</P>

<ol>
    <LI><b>Use the convenient attribute interface</b>

        <br>
        Select the object you want to modify, then double click on it in the
        <A HREF="tut_frames.html">Map-Archetype Panel Window</A> (on the right
        side). You could alternatively select it and press the "Attributes"
        button on the <A HREF="tut_frames.html">Object Attribute Window</A>. A
        popup window will appear, containing all object attributes in a
        graphical user interface.
        <br>
        Keep in mind that the syntax definitions for this entire thing are
        written in well-readable XML. So if you notice that some attribute is
        wrong, or missing, I strongly recommend you trying to edit the
        definitions file: "types.xml".

    <LI><b>Modify the archetype text directly</b>

        <br>
        Select the object you want, then modify the attributes directly in the
        <A HREF="tut_frames.html">Archetype text Window</A> (in the bottom-right
        corner).
        <br>
        But beware! You need to know exactly what you are doing there. If you do
        typos or set wrong values, you won't receive a warning. Modifying the
        archetype text directly is advisable for more experienced map makers
        only.
</ol>
