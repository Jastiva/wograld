<H1 align="center">Quests</H1>

<P>For the most part, Crossfire is about killing monsters. Players can kill
    monsters, gain experience and collect the loot. After a while though, this
    tends to get boring.</P>

<P>Quests are like the "salt in the soup". When a player gets involved in a task
    or plot which is more than just monster killing, that is a quest. Obviously
    quests are a must-have for any set of really good maps.</P>

<P>So how does one create a good quest? - There's no easy answer to this
    question. It's not only the plot, the storyline or the particular design
    which makes a quest good. It's the combination of everything.</P>

<P>The following chapters explain some of the key concepts for assembling really
    nice quests. (Unfortunately they are not yet written :-P)</P>
