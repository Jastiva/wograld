<h1>Treasurelists producing multiple items</h1>

<p>You can recognize this type of treasurelist by the icon:
    <img src="treasure_list.png" width="32" height="20" align="bottom" alt="[multi]">.
    Such a treasurelist can produce multiple items from the list. Items with no
    chance set are always generated - others are only generated when they
    succeed a random-roll at the given chance.</p>

<h2>Example for a treasurelist producing multiple items</h2>

<p>Look at the example below, the "giant" treasurelist:</p>

<p>Club, throwing skill and boulders will always be generated. Gold coins have a
    chance of 65% to be generated, and there is only a 10% chance that one item
    out of the giant_parts list is generated.</p>

<p>Numbers like in "<b>80</b> goldcoin" indicate that if chance succeeds, a
    stack of 1-80 gold coins can appear.</p>

</p>

<h2>Example for a treasurelist using YES/NO option</h2>

<p>Note that chances of different items do not influence each other in any way.
    However, the YES/NO option allows to set dependencies between items. Look at
    the example below, the "goblin" treasurelist:</p>

<p>There is a 10% chance for the bow to be generated. Now <b>if</b> the bow is
    generated, automatically arrows are generated too.</p>

<p>There is a 5% chance for the sword to be generated. If that fails, the short
    sword has a 10% chance to be generated. If that fails again, there is a 15%
    chance for the dagger.</p>
