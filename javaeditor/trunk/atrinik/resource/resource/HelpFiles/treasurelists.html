<H3>What are Treasurelists?</H3>

<P>Whenever a monster is generated or loaded in the world of Daimonin, items are
    placed in it's inventory according to the monster's treasurelist.
    <br>
    Hence, treasurelists define what items get dropped when the monster is
    killed. Even more importantly, they define which skills and spells the
    monster has at it's disposal.
</P>
<P>
    You can view the treasurelists by selecting menu "Resources-&gt;View
    Treasurelists", or from the <A HREF="tut_objects.html">attribute dialog</A>.
