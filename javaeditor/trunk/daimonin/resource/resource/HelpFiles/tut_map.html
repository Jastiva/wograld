<H1 align=center>Basics for Designing a Map</H1>

<P>Once you have opened a map, you can start to shape and modify it. You can do
    the following actions with your mouse:</P>

<UL>
    <LI>left mouse button: select object(s)
    <LI>right mouse button: insert an object
    <LI>middle mouse button: delete an object
</UL>
<P>If your mouse has less than three buttons, you can simulate the missing
    buttons by holding &lt;shift&gt; or &lt;ctrl&gt;:
    <br>
    right-click = "click & &lt;shift&gt;" and middle-click = "click & &lt;ctrl&gt;".
</P>

<P>
    To <B>select</B> an object, left click on it. You can do so either on the
    map window or in the map-archetype panel window to the right. If you want to
    select a group of squares on the map (e.g. for copy/paste actions), left
    click and drag. You will notice a rectangular area getting highlighted as
    you drag.</P>

<P>
    To <B>insert</B> a new object, you must first select one of the arches from
    the default-archetype panel to the left. Right click to insert the selected
    arch into the map. You can also right-click into the map-archetype panel in
    order to insert the object at a specific place in a pile of objects. You can
    drag the mouse on the map view in order to insert the same arch on many
    squares.</P>

<P>
    To <B>delete</B> an object, simply middle click on it. You can drag the
    mouse to delete multiple objects. Deleting specific objects out of a stack
    is possible by middle-clicking in the map-archetype panel.
    <br>
    (If your mouse has no middle-button you can simulate it by pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;any
    mouse button&gt;.)
</P>

<P>
    There is a convenience function for inserting walls into a map: The "<B>auto
    joining</B>"-feature. Activate the checkbox in the menu "Map->Auto-Joining"
    to enable it. Whenever you insert or delete a wall now, any walls of the
    same type will automatically join to form a continuous solid wall. This
    saves you the hassle of switching between all the different wall-arches.
    <br>
    If using any arch set other than the standard one, you might need to
    customize the file "autojoin.txt" in order to have the autojoining feature
    work for all the available wall-styles.
