<P>
    <A HREF="treasurelists.html"><IMG SRC="back.gif" WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="22" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0">Back</A>

<H1 align=center>Treasurelists producing one item</H1>

<P>You can recognize this type of treasurelist by the icon:
    <IMG SRC="treasureone_list.png" WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM">, as
    well as the name ending with "[one]". Such a treasurelist produces always
    exactly one item from the list. The objects on the list can have different
    chances set (the %-values in brackets), which indicate that some items are
    more likely to get chosen, and other less likely.</P>

<P><b>Examples for treasurelists producing one item:</b>

    <br>
</P>
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td><IMG SRC="treasure1.jpg" WIDTH="219" HEIGHT="155" ALIGN="CENTER">
        </td>
        <td><IMG SRC="treasure2.jpg" WIDTH="257" HEIGHT="87" ALIGN="CENTER">
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<P>As you can see in the right hand side example, treasurelists may contain yet
    other treasurelists. If chosen, such sub-lists get processed in recursive
    fashion. You can view the contents of each sub-list by clicking on the
    expand-mark.</P>
