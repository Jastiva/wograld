How to run the editor:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Simply run the jar file "CrossfireEditor.jar" in the main directory.
In Windows this is done by a double-click on "CrossfireEditor.jar".
In Linux/Unix you type in the console: "java -jar CrossfireEditor.jar".

If you have enough memory, it is recommended to run the editor
with a higher maximum memory size, like 128 Mb:
"java -jar -Xmx128m CrossfireEditor.jar"
(Note that in this way, the editor won't *always* use 128 Mb.
It will only use that much when it is required.)


In case there is no jar file available, that means you will need
to compile the editor from the sources first. Read next paragraph.


How to build the CrossfireEditor from sources:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have checked out the Gridarta sources from SVN, or
downloaded a "developer version", then you've got the Java sources.
Now you can modify the Java code, you can add classes, but please
don't move or rename any directories.

When you find yourself in the position that you want to compile the
Java sources for the editor, you need Apache Ant. Visit
<http://ant.apache.org/> for more information about Ant.


Compiling the sources:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Install Ant on your system. Make sure both the JAVA_HOME
and ANT_HOME environment variables are set correctly.

Change into the crossfire sub-directory or the Gridarta directory.
On the console type "ant" - that's all.


(Note that, if you want, you can also run the editor with
ant by typing "ant run". This does exactly the same as
"java -jar CrossfireEditor.jar".)


How to create a CrossfireEditor release package:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A "release" version is meant to be a complete running version of
the CrossfireEditor, without sources. A binary so to speak, though for
Java the most suitable thing is a jar file.
The jar file will contain everything except pickmaps, hence a
release package should only contain these two things:
Jar file and pickmaps.

1. Run Ant to create the jar file "CrossfireEditor.jar" (see above).

2. Assemble jar file and pickmaps in the following directory tree:

   crossfire/
       resource/
           pickmaps/
               [all pickmap files]
       CrossfireEditor.jar
       ChangeLog

3. Zip the package in a widely available compression format.
   Preferably use tar.gz as this is available both on Unix/Linux
   and windows (winzip).


System requirements & Supported Java Versions:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You need at least 128 MB of system RAM and 400 MHz CPU speed
in order to run the editor. It has been reported to work
on systems with lesser specs, but the speed was very slow.
