<h1>Special treasurelists</h1>

<p>Some treasurelists are used for special purposes. These can be found in the
    sub-folders "God Intervention", "Dragon Player Evolution" and "Player
    Creation". They cannot be used in maps.</p>

<p>The "God Intervention" lists are of special importance. They define which
    bonuses the Crossfire gods donate to their worshippers. These lists are
    traversed from top to bottom and the grace_limit objects are only passed
    when the worshipping player has a certain amount of grace.</p>

<p>Below you see the treasurelist of the god Gnarg (as of 24.10.2002, the list
    might have changed in the meantime).</p>
