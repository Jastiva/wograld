<H1 align=center>Cut/Copy/Paste and Fill</H1>

<P>Often you will want to copy, move, delete or fill large areas of your map. To
    accomplish this, you can use the appropriate commands from the
    Edit-menu.</P>

<P><B>Clear:</B>

    <br>
    By activating the Clear-command, everything in the currently selected area
    of the map will be deleted. Unlike for the Cut-command, the copy buffer
    remains unchanged.
</P>

<P><B>Cut:</B>

    <br>
    By activating the Cut-command, everything in the currently selected area of
    the map will be deleted and stored into the copy buffer.
</P>

<P><B>Copy:</B>

    <br>
    By activating the Copy-command, everything in the currently selected area is
    stored into the copy buffer. The map itself remains unchanged.
    <br>
    (Note that multi-part objects will usually be copied only when their
    "head"-tile is located within the selected area. Since the position of this
    "head"-tile differs, expect some strange behavior there.)
</P>

<P><B>Paste:</B>

    <br>
    The paste command allows to dump the contents of the copy buffer onto the
    map. First, select a square on the map to be the top-left corner of the
    pasted area. Anything which doesn't fit within the borders of the map will
    not get pasted. Multi-part objects which would reach outside of the map
    borders, and be it only with their small toe, don't get pasted either.
</P>

<P><B>Fill:</B>

    <br>
    There are two fill commands: "Fill Below" and "Fill Above". The difference
    between those two should be pretty obvious: If any selected map squares are
    not empty, the new arches will get inserted either above top (-&gt; Fill
    Above), or below bottom (-&gt; Fill below).
</P>
<P>Both fill commands can be used in two different ways:</P>

<ol>
    <LI> Select *one* empty square and hit fill: All empty squares adjacent to
        the selected one will get flood filled.
    <LI> Select an area or a non-empty square: The currently selected default
        arch will be inserted on top of (or below) every square within the
        selected area.
</ol>
