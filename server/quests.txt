	Introduction

Note: For all four races the basic overarching theme quests are essentially the same, but they may come to hear about it differently depending on what town npc is asked the question about the overarching world quest.  Or they could just start immediately going over to the shrines and collecting the quests there. The town people however will be happy to point anyone in the right direction.  Thesse towns people are as follows

J'glib, Korat -orc
Eldwid, Cedwyn – elf
Mourn Malva– undead
Niodia Daran – human

There are certain keywords you can say that will prompt an npc to tell you more, similar to ultima online's keyword system. Simply use the say(npc) command with the given key word in the same room as the npc who wants to answer you. This is good because you could keep saying the keyword, and npcs will  not ruin your conversations with spam unless you specifically ask them too (the exceptions are the “annoying” npcs such as the elderly people with demetia from the old folks home.  They will interupt you constantly if you are not talking periodically with an i don't know what to do, I don't know where I”m at unless you continually chat.)
In order to get this you say the word quest or quest to any npc.  They will make a list of the quest using the names of the quests in bold, for instance, if a given npc knows about a blacksmith quest, a mining quest, and a quest near the shrine of paranoia they would say  for example
npc: I am a BLACKSMITH of some renown.  I have also done some MINING near the shrine of PARANOIA. 

Orc town
Keyword quest, quests

orc: J'glib and Korat know humans are stupid.  That is why humans invented the nine stupidites.
Keyword humans
orc: Humans are are greatest foes.  If only the orc chieftens could bring us together under one banner, then we could crush them once and for all.
Keyword J'glib
orc: If I were an elf I would say he was in the library.  Elves read too  much and don't do enough. Check the hut next to the shamen trainer.  If he is not awake try Korat
Keyword Korat
orc: I should not call Korat an orc really, she is not worthy of the name, goblin scum.  Check the hut behind the shaman trainer.  She is only allowed here because we needed another lorekeeper. 


Elf town
Elf: Before the fall of the tyrant king, there was a development that changed the very nature of our world.  Everyone should know this story.  I am surprised you are asking now. Over time the inhabitents of this world developed nine principles.  There are nine shrines and dungeons attributed to them.

Keyword shrines, dungeons.
Elf: The shrines and dungeons are the same. Paranoia, indiscretion, Lust, Thievery, Masochism, Humiliation, Skepticism, Vengeance Foolhardiness. Please ask Eldwid or Cedwyn if you want to know more.
Keyword Eldwid
Elf: Unless he is in bed, you can find him in the library, or his  replacement, Cedwyn, who can also answer your questions. 
Keyword Cedwyn
Unless he is in bed, you can find him in the library, or her  replacement, Eldwid, who can also answer your questions. 

Undead town
Keyword shrines
undead: The only things left in this world still worshiped are stupid, or rather the stupidities.  They are Paranoia, indiscretion, Lust, Thievery, Masochism, Humiliation, Skepticism, Vengeance Foolhardiness.  Mourn would know about that, and so would Malva.

Keyword dungeons
Undead: The dungeons are the same as the shrines. They are Paranoia, indiscretion, Lust, Thievery, Masochism, Humiliation, Skepticism, Vengeance Foolhardiness.  Mourn would know about that, and so would Malva.

Keyword: Mourn
Undead: He can be found the the library ussually.

Keyword: Malva
Undead: She likes to haunt the library.

Keyword: Orcs, orc 
Undead: We like orcs, generally.  Do orcs like us, We are not so sure.

Keyword: Elves, Elf
Undead: Elves do not really appreciate their long lives, for what is life without death.

Keyword: Humans, human
Undead: Humanity is one thing  you can sacrifice and end up better off.

Keyword: Undead
Undead: You see what we are.

Human town
Keyword: dungeons, shrines
Human: The greatest achievement of mankind, the     
NINE stupidites, each have a shrine and the dungeon. You can ask Niodia or Daran in the library.

Keyword: Nine
Human: You are already a fool, but I will help you anyway. The nine stupidities are They are Paranoia, indiscretion, Lust, Thievery, Masochism, Humiliation, Skepticism, Vengeance Foolhardiness.  They each have a shrine and a dungeon. If you  want to know more you can ask Niodia or Daran.

Keyword: Niodia, Daran
If it isn't one, it is the other.  You can ask Niodia or Daran about the nine stupidities.  They will tell you more.

Quest Human:

Keyword: stupidities, stupid
Niodia,Daran: I am probably one of the most knowledgeable people in town about this matter.  I suggest you read up the books in the library.  Read the fine manual. After all, I am one of the co-authors.

Keyword: Library

Fool, it is the place where you are now.

Keyword: Paranoia, Cat, talk

The shine of Paranoia is located to the south-east.
There is a cat sitting at the shrine, talk to it.

Keyword: dungeons shrines.

You were sent by someone else to talk with me, I am certain. But what you seek could be found in any of several books on the subject instead of wasting my time asking questions.

Keyword: Lust

The shrine of Lust is awfully close to elf lands, well on the western edge of them.  Elves think about such things too much.  There are always several priests and priestess there who can give you some help, but it is not the kind of help I would want. 

Keyword: Indiscretion

They say that is my greatest stupidity.  Considering its icon is an open book, for a librarian it is not surprising. Ironically, it is on the northen border of the orc lands. Cosidering they barely read and dont' even have a library why it was build there I do not know. Stupid.

Keyword: Vengence.


It is north of the undead lands. Why go out and hurt people when  you can sit and read.  Ussually people seeking vengence hang around the shrine and expect you to help them.

Keyword: Masochism

It is south of human lands. The shrine is in the middle of a maze and it is tedious to get there. There is no getting around the tediousness of the quests there. 

Keyword Foolhardiness

If I were you, I would skip this one. You may not come back in one piece. But do adventurers listen? No, they do not realize what they could lose.  It is west of human lands.

Keyword Thievery:

If you must know the thievery shrine is just east of the orc lands. Be careful, do not carry anything you do not want to lose.  There are thieves hidden all in and around the shrine. 

Keyword Humiliation:

Humilation is south of the elflands.  Last time I went, I ripped a hole in my pants. Beware, the monsters there are tougher than they would first appear. 

Keyword Skepticism:

I do not believe this shrine or dungeon exisits, yet rummor has it that it is far south east of human lands, well, actually it is rather centrally located between all the races. I do not believe that it has four entrances either. I do not believe an entire dungeon could be without magical creatures either. That has got to be at least one in there like maybe a unicorn. 

Keyword hell:
Hell is a place I would like to avoid going. It is down underground.  It is very easy to go there if you do something bad.

Keyword mage tower:  There is this mage that lives in a tower to the south. He is very reclusive. But if you want to know anything he already knows it, or how to learn it, at least that is what the rummors say.

Keyword: Haunted insane aslylum.

During the tyrant kings reign, fools were sent there to rot. And they did, litterally.  Now all that is left is ruins and the walking dead. 

Quest Elf:

Keyword: stupidities, stupid
Eldwid,Cedwyn: Elves have wisdom.  Humans, orcs and undead have folly. But we live in this world and have a need to understand the other races.  You are still young yet to this world.  Ask me about any of the nine stupidities and I will point you in the right direction.

Keyword: Library

We elves have the biggest library, the human and undead ones are smaller, and the orcs lack what you could call a library. 

Keyword: Paranoia, Cat, talk

The shine of Paranoia is located to the south-west.
There is a cat sitting at the shrine, talk to it.

Keyword: dungeons shrines.

You can read any of several books on the subject in the library, I recommend History of the Stupidities, and Nine stupidites to start with. Check the card catlog next to me to see where they are located.

Keyword: Lust

The shrine of Lust is almost on our western border lands.  There are always several priests and priestess there who can give you some help.

Keyword: Indiscretion

I believe it is better to  say nothing that to be so impolite in most circumstances, but sometimes one must speak up. The goblins that surround the shrine will be frank with you, but you should not take what they say personally. It is north of the orc lands, south west of ours and south of the human lands.


Keyword: Vengence.

It is north of the undead lands. Vengence itself is not wise, but sometimes one must play the fool to learn wisdom.

Keyword: Masochism

It is south of human lands. The shrine is in the middle of a maze that constantly changes. Some preparation beforehand by reading the entire library collection on masochism may make it easier to understand how it works. 

Keyword Foolhardiness

The monsters here are some of the hardest in wograld. Preparation is essential. Hopefully you have already gained some skill in your proffessions.  It is east of human lands. And west of ours.

Keyword Thievery:

The thievery shrine is just east of the orc lands. Be careful, do not carry anything you do not want to lose.  There are thieves hidden all in and around the shrine. 

Keyword Humiliation:

Humilation is south of the elf lands.  The monsters there are tougher than they would first appear. 

Keyword Skepticism:

The dungeon skepticism exists far to south east of human lands. Although it is somewhat centrally located in the  continent. It has four entrances. Magick does not work there so you will need to find some other means to deal with the monsters and thugs within the dungeon.  The shrine should have a unicorn and several skeptics. Speak with them all. 

Keyword hell:
In order to complete your journey into being a fool, you will need to go to hell, also known as the abyss.  I for all my wisdom to not know about it since it is not wise to try to go there. 

Keyword mage tower:  There is this mage that lives in a tower to the south. He is very reclusive. But if you want to know anything he already knows it, or how to learn it, at least that is what the rummors say.

Keyword: Haunted insane aslylum.

During the tyrant kings reign, fools were sent there to rot. And they did, literally.  Now all that is left is ruins and the walking dead. It is close to undead lands, but to the northwest.

Quest Orc:

Keyword: stupidities, stupid
J'glib, Korat: Stupid humans invented the nine stupidities.

Keyword: Library

This is not a library. Stupid elves think they have the largest library but the biggest one is at the shrine of indiscretion.

Keyword: Paranoia, Cat, talk

The shine of Paranoia is located to the south-west.
There is a cat sitting at the shrine, but talking cats are scary.

Keyword: dungeons shrines.

You already know what they are.

Keyword: Lust

The shrine of Lust is far to the north-east bordering elf lands.  There are always several priests and priestess there.  Stupid elves, kill them.

Keyword: Indiscretion

You could always kill the goblins around this shrine, unless you want to be a stupid fool. Yes, you want to be a stupid fool, don't you. It is not far to the north.


Keyword: Vengence.

It is north of the undead lands and far to the east of her. Vengence is a great thing, but only against non-orcs, easpeacily humans and elves. 

Keyword: Masochism

Masochism is good as well.  It is farther to the north than indiscretion. You may get lost, but I know you will be able to find your way back here when the time comes. 

Keyword Foolhardiness

The monsters there are quite a challenge, but with the help of your clan even the toughest monsters will fall.   It is east of human lands, and far to the northwest of ours.

Keyword Thievery:

The thievery shrine is just east of the orc lands. They take stuff from you. Just kill them. 

Keyword Humiliation:

Far to the northest is the shrine of humilation, that is also due south of the elf lands.   The monsters there are tougher than they would first appear. 

Keyword Skepticism:

The dungeon skepticism exists far to south east of human lands. Although it is somewhat centrally located in the  continent. It has four entrances. Fortunatly, Magick does not work there.   The shrine has a unicorn and several skeptics. Kill them all. 

Keyword hell:
Great place to hang out, espeacaily the entrances. Yeah, sooner or later you will find out how to get there.  If you are still asking me about the nine stupidities,  you are  not even close to heading there.

Keyword mage tower:  There is this mage that lives in a tower to the south. He is very reclusive. He says he is the smartest person in the world, yet for all his knowledge he could be defeated by a large enough army of orcs if we could organize one. 

Keyword: Haunted insane aslylum.

During the tyrant kings reign, fools were sent there to rot. And they did, literally.  It is a good place to loot now that no one cares about the left over walking dead. It is close to undead lands, but to the northwest.

Quest Undead:

Keyword: stupidities, stupid
Mourn, Malva: The nine stupidites were invented by humans, but all of us are fools in one way or another.  My favorite  one is vengence.  That is why I am a librarian. My mother threw out my favorite old books when I was young,  now I can save the oldest and moldiest tomes and no one is there to stop me mwhahaha. 

Keyword: Library

This where you are now. You can read many books on many subjects, but they may be a little out of date now our collection is so old. 

Keyword: Paranoia, Cat, talk

The shine of Paranoia is located to the south-west.
There is a cat sitting at the shrine.  You might think that you would scare the cat away but there is nothing more frighening than a cat sitting there and calmly talking to you.


Keyword: dungeons shrines.

The dungeons and shrines are the same, Paranoia, Lust Indiscretion, Vengence, Humiliation, Skeptisism, Masochism, Thievery, Foolhardiness.

Keyword: Lust

The shrine of Lust is far to the north-east bordering elf lands.  There are always several priests and priestess there.  They say love goes beyond death, but lust certainly does not, at least in my experience. Still people strivee after it, fools, all of them. 

Keyword: Indiscretion

Let me be blunt, you will not like what the goblins say to you at this shrine when you talk to them.  But you would become a fool to continue to take the insults. Yet I know that is what you are striving towards. You are a fool to even try. It is west, just north of orc lands, goblins are poor excuses for orcs after all. 


Keyword: Vengence.

It is north of the undead lands. Vengence is what keeps us going when things look bad, when you have lost everything, the only thing left is the burning anger that devors everything else. 

Keyword: Masochism

Masochism is good as well.  It is farther to the north than indiscretion. You may get lost, but I know you will be able to find your way back here when the time comes. 

Keyword Foolhardiness

Many people die in the dungeon of Foolhardiness, and you can take advantage of the fact. Sometimes a little fear is all it takes for them to fail. Do be careful with the tasks given at the shrine that you do not take on more than  you can handle. It is east of human lands, and far to the northwest of ours.

Keyword Thievery:

The thievery shrine is just east of the orc lands and far to the west of ours. They take stuff from you. The only good thief is a dead thief, unless you are the thief.

Keyword Humiliation:

Far to the northest is the shrine of humilation, that is also due south of the elf lands.   Humans often worry about  humilation, but when you are dead, you no longer care.

Keyword Skepticism:

The dungeon skepticism exists far to south east of human lands. Although it is somewhat centrally located in the  continent. It has four entrances. Magick does not work there.   The shrine has a unicorn and several skeptics. I would not doubt the skeptics. 

Keyword hell:

Undeath is better than hell, so I would not complain about it. Stay in  this world as long as possible. The crossing is long and hard, so it would be better to not to cross at all prehaps. 


Keyword mage tower:  There is this mage that lives in a tower to the north west. He keeps to himself. One could learn much from him yet at what price? There is more than one way that you would have to pay for that knowledge. He says he is the smartest person in the world, yet for all his knowledge he could be defeated by a large enough army of orcs if we could organize one. 

Keyword: Haunted insane asylum.

During the tyrant kings reign, fools were sent there to rot. They have become dead in mind and spirit as well as flesh. Yet they still walk. It is to the northwest of here.

	Paranoia quests

Cat quest chain

Keyword Paranoia
Cat: Are you afraid of me? Why should you be frighened of  me, after all I am just a small cat sitting on a shrine.  I have some tasks for you to do as well, some things that you can get me.
First of all I want you to get some sand from the Hakkaria desert. Beware the fire dragons, but you only need the sand.  Then I want you to get me a box.  Any box made by a carpenter or blacksmith or purchased on a vendor is fine.  Then I want you to put the sand in the box and bring it to me. Can  you do that? 
Answer no
Well, I think you should at least try.  It is really not that hard to fill a box with sand, come on and I will give you a secret ingredient that you will need. 

Answer yes: Then you accept the quest.

(after you come back bringig the box of sand)
Cat: I see you have the box of Hakkaria desert sand. How good that is. Please set the box down next to pedistal.  I will use it soon.
(cat steps over the box and leaves something small and brown)
Cat: You can take what I have left for you in the box now. It will be of use to you in seeing a certain monster.

Cat: there is a farm nearbye here. The farmere is having trouble with his cows and crop circles.  It is far beyond what I can handle, I only  hunt mice.

Keyword mice:
Cat: Yes, they are small and fun to hunt.  If you bring me some food I will get you my latest kill. 

Farmer: I am a farmer.  I sell crops.  Was there something else you wanted.

Keyword Crop circles:

Farmer: Have you looked around my fields. I see all kinds of strange rings.  I do not know what could have cause it.  Also, my cows have been getting mutilated. I thoought it was just my imagination at first, but I keep good track of my livestock. I cannot let this deed go unpunished. I would go to the shrine of vengence, but I do not know who is responsible for thesse atrocities.

Keyword cows:
You see my cows have been dying in a horriable and strange manner. Sometimes I see them, their intestines removed, their hides branded in a strange manner.  I need to find out who is responsible for this matter. I do not know if you have any ideas about it. 

(go to the fields and wander around, eventually you will see a triangular shapped teleporter, stand it and you will teleport to dungeon paranoia.

Grey alien: The cows are slaves of ours, after dying and being reborn, they are now our servents.

Grey alien: We use the crop circles to mark where we have been. It gives us great pleasure to know someone has taken notice.

Keyword, Farmer,  vengence

Grey alien: If you mean to kill us, know that vengence against us will not bring any reward for a paranoid fool. After all, no matter how many times you may seem to kill an alien,  you know more are always willing to take its place.  Why is that? Because we are all one, we are all many, but we are also all one, now do you understand. 

Keyword one:

Grey alien: We can read eachothers minds, us aliens that is, what one knows all will know. You should be more concerned about your own people, and not crop circles and cows. Did you know that there is a conspiracy going on right now between your own people. 

Farmer: So it is aliens eh? I don't care what that alien says, give me ten crushed UFOs.  I don't care if you have to crush them yourself. I hate those alien things messing up my farm. 

Farmer: I see you have the ufos.  I bet there is more stuff you could kill, give me twenty alien brain stems as proof of how many you got. 

Grey alien: That farmer, you know the one who is complaining about crop circles, he is actually a member of conspiracy group ploting to over throw your government.  I already have spies surroundinng his house, but you need to get some documets for me. I think he trusts you now that you have killed so many aliens. Find the documents he signed proving his involvement and give them to the head CIA agent. Once you have done that I will give you a reward. 

Farmer: Of course I am not a member of any conspiracy group.  I am a good upstanding Wograld citizen. I cause no trouble.  Hey, where would you get an idea like that.

Keyword:
aliens

Farmera: I would not believe anything that some crop circle making cow multalating aliens say, would you trust something like that. I would hope not. Anyway, I am not the only farmer with this problem, there are a few others who have witnessed it. We are  having a meeting soon, you are welcome to attend.

Farmera: We will now call this meeting to order.

Farmerb: Do we have any new business.

Farmerc: no

Farmerd: no

Farmera: We have a new potential member.

Farmerb: and who might that be.

Farmera $yourname has been helping to destroy the alien invaders. We think that $yourname would be a valueable addition to our group. 

Farmerd: does $yourname  have a farm here with a crop circle problem?

Farmera: Nope, but $yourname here has been a great help to me. I have not seen the aliens leave any new crop circles here. 

Farmerb: $yourname will have to prove $hisher worth. Listen $yourname, we have a package to deliver to the mayor. The town mayor has not done much about our concerns.  We have been painted as a bunch of nut cases.  But with your help, I think we can convince the mayor to be on our side. Here, take this package.

Farmerb: Anymore business

Farmera: No
Farmerc: No
Farmerd: No
Farmerb: meeting adjoirned. (the farmers file out all except for farmera who owns the farm.

Keyword package.

Farmera: You should just deliver it to the mayor. 

Mayor: Is that a package for me? If so, give it to my secretary. I do not actually open my own mail you know.

Mayor: I'm busy don't bother me.

Secretary: Is this for the Mayor?  Yes, I see that it is for him.  We have to be very careful of late. Some people have been trying to hurt the Mayor.  What is inside?  Did you pack it yourself.

(you have two choices, no or yes, ultimatly it does  not  make much difference, but you also gain points for indiscretion by saying no)

$yournamehere: No
(gain points for indiscretion here)
Secretary: Well, then I can not accept this package, I am sorry. Paranoia isn't just a stupidity, it is one of the rules we live by here.


$yournamehere: yes

Secreetary: Well I will open this and see what is inside. I am not sure if you are aware that I am also an enchanter, and can detact spells, enhancements and all sorts of magical traps. Oh, this items is enchanted alright, it is set to harm the mayor as soon as the mayor touches it. I'm going to have to send you to the insane asylum, guards.

(guards grab you, you are teleportered to the insane asylum, fortunatly it is the haunted insane asylum so it is rather easy to get out, you know those different departments of so called government never talk to one another)

Farmera: Did you deliver the package I sent you with?

You: (said yes and delivered the package)

Farmera: Sorry about your trip to the insane aslyum, you see what we we have all had to go through here to get our problems addressed. I'll be the secretary said that it was trapped or some such, am I right? Yes of course I am right, they are all out to get you. 

You: (said no and delivered the package)

Farmera: You are a terrable liar. I can tell that you have been through a lot. Sorry about your trip to the insane aslyum, you see what we we have all had to go through here to get our problems addressed. I'll be the secretary said that it was trapped or some such, am I right? Yes of course I am right, they are all out to get you. 

You: (said no and did not deliver the package)
(gain in indiscretion)
Farmera: So they are not accepting packages at the mayors office. Figures.  I guess they are getting paranoid that some one is really out to get them there. 

You: (said yes and did not deliver the package)
Farmera: Quit lying to me.  If you are going to play games like that, you had best go to the shrine of theivery where you belong. 

(regardless of answer, next dialog is the same)
Farmera: Now that you have proven to me that you are loyal and worthy, I will let you in on a little secret, the so called Mayor is really an alien.  All we have to do now is expose the mayors alien identity, and then the mayor will have to leave office. I guess we will get a new mayor then, one who will be more sympathetic to our plight. But the way to do that is going to take some thought and work.


	Lust quests
Quest1 Letters of Lust
$npc1: I have long fanced $npc2 could you give $himher2 this message that I have writen.

	Dearest $npc2, I have waited so long to write to you. You are my starlight and my moonlight. The trees sway where you walk. I have watched you from afar, and now I long to get closer. Prehaps it is silly of me to write this letter of introduction, but I cannot get you out of my mind. My days and nights are filled with thoughts of you. I frequently see you in my dreams, where you are smiling at me and beconing  me to come closer, yet, when it seems like I am close to you, I am suddenly afraid to say what is on my mind. I am afraid you will reject me, and I can not bear the thought that you would do such a thing.
	I want to give you everything I have and dedicate my life to you, for what purpose does life have without the love that I feel for you. My passion knows no bounds, and nothing in heaven earth or even hell could keep us apart. I would gladly be declared a fool and complete all nine stupidites for you. I would even go to hell and back for you. If only you would respond to this letter, just one word, that you aknowledge that you have receieved and read it would give me greatest joy. 
	With greatest love,
	$npc1

$npc1:	I don't know that I will ever receive such a response. I would love to have one though, and will keep on sending them until I get a response, but I think it is far more  likely if you were to give $himher2 this letter personally. I want  you to find $himher2 at $hisher $location where $heshe has been staying recently. Please send me a word of return. I would love to have a response. Normally  I would have gone through the normal mail, but with all the wars going on, far to many of thosse get lost or stolen, so please help my lovesick heart and deliver this letter.


(you take the letter and deliveer it to $npc2)

$npc2: You are looking for  me, what is this letter.
$npc2: (reads the letter out loud.)
Dearest $npc2, I have waited so long to write to you. You are my starlight and my moonlight. The trees sway where you walk. I have watched you from afar, and now I long to get closer. Prehaps it is silly of me to write this letter of introduction, but I cannot get you out of my mind. My days and nights are filled with thoughts of you. I frequently see you in my dreams, where you are smiling at me and beconing  me to come closer, yet, when it seems like I am close to you, I am suddenly afraid to say what is on my mind. I am afraid you will reject me, and I can not bear the thought that you would do such a thing.
	I want to give you everything I have and dedicate my life to you, for what purpose does life have without the love that I feel for you. My passion knows no bounds, and nothing in heaven earth or even hell could keep us apart. I would gladly be declared a fool and complete all nine stupidites for you. I would even go to hell and back for you. If only you would respond to this letter, just one word, that you aknowledge that you have receieved and read it would give me greatest joy. 
	With greatest love,
	$npc1 

$npc2: I'm not sure what to say. I admit I am flattered that npc1 has taken such an iterest in me, but $hesshe1 is really not my type. I am sorry, but I can not return the love in the way that $npc1 would probably like sooner or later $heshe1 is going to be disapointed. I suppose I should send a note saying I read it though, otherwise I will probably get more letters of this sort, or maybe not.

	$npc1 Hi, this is $npc2 I received you letter.  I am flattered that you are so interested in me, but I am really not your type. I want you to not waste any more time sending me letters, or conquering hell for me. Surely you would be disappointed to find that I do not share the same interest in  you that you do in me. 
	Kindest regards,
		$npc2

$npc1:  $heshe2 loves me? $heshe2 loves me not? Oh, good to see you here, $yourname. I am so glad that you have come do you have my letter.

$npc1: (reading the letter writen by npc2) 

$npc1 Hi, this is $npc2 I received you letter.  I am flattered that you are so interested in me, but I am really not your type. I want you to not waste any more time sending me letters, or conquering hell for me. Surely you would be disappointed to find that I do not share the same interest in  you that you do in me. 
	Kindest regards,
		$npc2

I am disappointed, I admit, but I will not give up $heshe2 said Kindest regards.  Maybe that means deep down $heshe has some feelings for me but is afraid to express them. Maybe I was too forward and direct in that last letter. Prehaps I have been following the stupidity of indiscretion a bit to closely. Here, I will write another letter. 

	Dear $npc2, I am sorry if that last letter put you off. Maybe it made me sound like I am some obsessed creep. I am really not. I may have made myself sound too desperate. All I want is a little bit of time with you to get to know you better. Prehaps we could arange a meeting. There is only so much I can say in thesse letters.  I try to speak like I woould in person, but in person it is different. I feel I would not have the time to say what I mean if you understand my meaning. You could chosse the time and place, somewhere convient for you prehaps at $location. I will come to see you when you are avalible, but I want you to be there, and not intrupt what it is that you are doing now, so please let me know what a convient time and place woould be. If you can't think of one, I could think of one. 
	Foundest regards,
		$npc1

Here, take this letter to my love, $npc2. I want you to do this as soon as possible without delay. I am sure that $npc2 will respond to my efforts, as $heshe has responed to me before. I am glad that you are going to do this. I so want to to spend the time with $npc2 that I am willing to do anything to obtain that privledge. 

$Npc2: What is this another letter for me.  Is it from the same person. I already told $npc1 I am not interested, but prehaps it is from someone else.

$Npc2: Oh no, it is indeed from $npc. I was hopeing that it was not. (reads the letter)

		$npc1

Yes, $npc1 really does come off like a creep. After I politly declined, why would one still go on and on about their interest in me. The whole thing is absurd. But now I supposed I shall have to resort to the stupiditiy of indiscretion to get this $npc1 off my back. I do hate to do it so much, because otherwise $npc1 seems rather nice, but I don't waste my time with people just because they are nice. I have my own ideas about who I choose to share my life with. 

	Dear $npc1, I hate to be blunt, but you do not really seem to get the point. I do not want to be contacted by you about any of this. It is not just your letters, I just am not interested, period, end of story. Please do not bother me about this matter again. I do not want to meet up with you to have a little chat or whatever.  My time is far to valueable to be dragged into doing things I have no interest in like your idea of a blind date. Please leave me alone,
	sincerely (and indescretly),
	$npc2

Yes, do that this to $himher1, and let this matter drop. I do think even if $npc1 is as dense as I precieve that this should put an end to the matter. Any more of these things and I will not longer respond. I have wasted enough time on the matter already, so do not waste anymore of my time on it. Go now and deliver this to $npc1, and put and end to the matter. 

$npc1: Did $heshe2 respond to my letter? Did $heshe2 get my message? I want to know if $npc2 has let me know of a meeting time and place. Please, to you have news?

(give $npc1 the letter)

	$npc2

Perhaps I am simply not trying hard enough to deal with this at all. Perhaps I have not made my intentions clear enough. I want $npc2 to know that I really love $himher2. How can I show how much I love $himher2?  I know, I can get $himher2 a gift, something with no strings attached.  I won't be demanding anything out of $npc2, I just want to show how much I care for $himher2.
I can have you get $gift1.  It is a token of my affection that I feel so strongly. I can not get $npc2 out of my mind.  Will you please help. Get $gift1 and bring it to $npc2.  Don't say it from me, just say that is from someone who cares deeply for $npc2.  Someone who cares enough to send a gift just because.

(get $gift1 )
(bring $gift1 to $npc2)

$npc2: Oh I see, is this for me?  Why are you bringing me this?
$yourname: It is from someone who cares deeply for you.
$npc2: Who could it be, I have no idea. Well that was very thoughtful of them. But I would like to know who it is so I can return the favor sometime, could you tell me who it was.
$yourname: No, but I could deliver a return gift if you would like.
$npc2: Well, since I am not sure who it was, I guess I could just write a quick thank you. 

	-Thanks for the gift $npc2
$npc2: I'm sure they will be happy to know that I received it. 

(take thank you note to npc1) (reward you get from npc1 should far more than cover the cost of the gift) 
npc1: Did $npc2 receive the gift?  Did $heshe2 like it? 
Yes, I see that $heshe liked it very much. It appears me strategy is working. Soon I will  have $himher2 intrested in meeting up with me. But now, I think I need to get $himher2 a bigger gift. Something grand, Yes, something more expensive. How about $gift2? I know it is more expensive and harder to find, but I think it would go a long way to make $npc2 warm up to me.

(get $gift2 )
(bring $gift2 to $npc2)

$npc2: Is this for me? Thank you. It seems I have been getting a lot of gifts lately. I do  not know why.  It is not my birthday or anything like that.  Perhaps you could explain me why I am suddenly being showered with so many presents.  I will send another thank you note, this time with a question.
	
	-Thanks for the $gift2 -$npc2, but please let me know who you are. 

$Npc1: Have you returned with giving $himher2 the $gift2 very good. I will now give an even more elaborate present, and prehaps it is time I tell $himher2 who I am after all. Please get $gift3 and bring it to $npc2. 

(get $gift3)
(bring to $npc2)

npc2: What is this for me, no, that is too expensive. I can not keep accepting things like this from someone I do not know. How do I know that it is not without obligation. I do not even know if somehow it is coming from my friends who were stolen from last week.  Those thieves at the shrine of thievery are always reaquring belongings.  So unless you tell me who this is from, I will not accept it. 
Yourname: it is from $npc1
npc2: I knew it, it is yet another obligation I do not wish to have. Please take it back to $himher1  I do not want $hisher company, so I will not accept expensive gifts that imply such an obligation. 

$npc1: How goes it, did $npc2 like the $gift3 I gave to $himher2?
(return gift)
$npc1: I see, you were not able to convince $himher2 to acepet  my present. But that does not stop my love for $npc2. I need  you to help me. I know that with the proper potion, anyone can fall in love with anyone else with few exceptions. I want you to get some of this potion and put it into the drink of $npc2  I will follow at a great distance and show when the potion takes effect. Then I will be able to spend time with $himher2. For the potion you will either need to get it from an alchemist or make  it yourself.  I will give you my essense now that is needed for the potion. Otherwise it will not work.  Once you have the potion, you are to get a drink for yourself and for $npc2 put the potion into $hisher2 drink, and then drink with $himher2.  Please do this for me. 
(get potion and two drinks.)
$npc2: Is this for me. I am rather thirsty. It was kind of you to get me a drink and drink with me. 
(npc2 drinks the drink)
$npc2: Oh, I feel so strange. I do not know what it is with me today.  You are so beautiful though. I want you to stay here with me. (npc2 looks around)
(npc1 shows up and sits with the two of you)
$npc2: Can it be that my favorite person is sitting next to me, but forgive me for being so indiscrete, I think I may have had a bit to much to drink. Hello $npc1, sit down here and we can talk.
$npc1: With great pleasure.
$npc2: You are the most wonderful person I have ever met, there is something about your eyes, they are watching me are they not. I want to go some place more private with you, I want you undivided attention now.
(npc1 looks uncomfortable now)
$npc1: there is no rush to do anything why can't $yourname stay here.
$npc2: Because I am the jealous type *laughs* Well, at least now we can  avoid having to deal with interuptions and distance. ($npc2 gets up from the table)

$npc1: Alright
(npc1 and npc2 get up from the table, later, npc1 approaches you)
$npc1: Hey wait, I want to talk with you $yourname.
$yourname: what?
$npc1: I am not truly in love with $npc2.  I was being quite silly, ultimatly I thought that $npc2 was something that $heshe2 is not, and I was sorely disappointed. I also did not like the jealousy and not being able to do what I want, so here is  your payment for helping me to become a fool in Lust. 


Lust quest2 Create your Desire

$npc1: I am a $priest/priestess of lust, trained in the art of catering to your desires, however, desire is different for everyone. Therefore, I can return you to a place when you can choose the object of your desire, right down to the race, skin  tone, eyes, and most importantly, gender of  your desire. Imagine, if you will, the very object that you have been dreaming about for ages catering to your every whim and want. Yes, you may even choose the personality, yes, the personality of your desire, for  what being is more perfect than when it responds to you in the way that you wish. 
(typical character creation screen here, where you can pick the traits, except now an npc is created instead of a new character)

$npc1: I know so many people want an army, or is that a harem of beings to serve there every whim, however there is a limit to the powers of this magic.  It pains me to say this, but yes, the creations do get, well jealous, a bit anyway sometimes. Besides, it takes a great deal of magic to create one, so there is only one per customer as it were. Prehaps at some furture date this can be rectified, but for now the manifestation of our desires does have limits.

$npc1: It is important that you also choose a personality for your new creation. 
Type A – Type A's are for people who like to be around thoose who think highly of themselves and never miss a change to brag or say how great and wonderful they are, being around this sort of creature can boost ones own value of themselves through identifying with your illustrius companion

Type A: I was created to be the most beautiful thing in the universe, and I am.  I am also quite accomplished in the arts and sciences, tell me if you need something done, and I am more than capable of doing it. There is very little I can not do. 

Type B – Type B's are for people who like to receive constant praise. Did other critizize you to much?  This creation will never critize you. This is the type who will tell you how wonderful you are all the time. (note, type A's will sometimes add a remark about how good they are after requests)

Type B: You are the most wonderful creature in the universe. Praise your greatness for bringing me into the universe. Without you, I could not exist. Never forget,  no matter what you do, you are wonderful. I do love you truly. (note, type B will always add praise after every request.)

Type C: – Type C's are Chatty and like conversation. They are most amiable to being your friend. You will  never feel  lonely with a Type C around as your constant companion.  

Type C: Hello, I'm pleased to be here with you. The weather is very fine this $timeofday. You can ask me about $stupidity or anything even of a personal nature. I will do my best to listen to your concerns and try to give advice if I feel I can help. Tell me more about yourself. Ask me anything.  (note, type C could be programed with a modified version of one of those psychotherapy programs to talk about any subject) 

Type D - Okay, maybe the rest of thesse are a little too chatty for your, you just want someone to shut up and do as you ask, not say anything unless absolutly nessessary. To get anything at all out of a type D could be a challenge, however, you will never be interupted with unessessary information. In order to chat with a type D, you must always specifically say $creation subject. Do so now with $creation intro (note, type D will never say anything unless specifically asked to so probably not the best type for newbies who need extra tips) 

Type D: I will do as you ask and give brief information only at your request.

Skeptism 

Quest1
$npc1: I do not actually believe that $monstername1 exists. I want you to go out and  slay $number1 of them. I feel that if I had some prof such as $headofmonstername1, that I would be able to to eliminate my doubts.

$npc1: I am glad to see that you have brought back $headofmonstername1.  However, seeing the $headof monstername1 does not give me real proff of their existance. Dead samples do not make me believe.  After all, a necromancer could have altered it after it decayed. So therefore, I need you to get $petcaptureitem and use the $petcaptureitem in order to bring me a live specimine. It works just like a teleporter, except containing the monster.

$Npc1: (open device, finds dead $monstername1) 
I see that you have brought back a corpse. That is not what I told you to do.  This is supposed to be able to keep it alive for some time.  However, this is another way prehaps that you could prove to me the existance of $monstername1.  You could escort me to where $monstername1 are spawning. When I see live ones moving about, then and only then will I believe what you say about the existance of $monstername1

(escort npc1 to where $monstername1 spawns.
Npc1: ieee, the $monstername1 is attacking me
($monstername1 is attacking $npc1)
npc: ieee I think I am going to die. I am so sorry I doubted you urgh. 
($npc1 dies)

$npc2: Have you heard anything about $npc1.  I heard that $heshe1 was looking for $monstername1 but never found it. $heshe made that $hisher  whole lifes work. 
(say npc1 died)
$npc2: if what you say is true and $npc1 died to the $monstername1, then how do I know you are not lying. Prehaps you are a murderer who has slain $npc1? I do not believe that the $monstername1 exisists, or that it is even capable of killing anyone. 

Skeptisism quest 2 – spellscroll quest.

Npc1: as you well know, magic does not exisit. I have heard however that there are fools who practice the art as if it were real. I want to see proof of what thosse idiots are up to.  To that end, I would like you to obtain certain artifacts for me. 2 first level mage scrolls should do the trick. It does not matter what disapline, they are all stupid, bloodmage, elementalist and necromancer alike. Do this for me, and you shall be dutifully rewarded.

Npc1: ah, I see you have the the scrolls. Obviously you can not use these. Look at me, I just tried to make sense of them, but nothing happened. I'm the sort of person who believes what I see. In order to do that, i will need to see a mage actually cast spells. To do that, you must escort me to the shrine of Humilation. There I will humilate thosse poor elementalist mage fools.

(you escort the npc to the shrine of humilation, once outside town, he follows you throught he portal or wherever once there, a mage at the shrine of humilation will also speak to you and your new deluded friend.)

npc1: Yes, you stupid fool mage, preform spells for me. I do not believe that you can cast any spells what so ever. (a lightning bolt will come out of the sky and strikes npc1)

npc1: That is just conincidence, I still do  not believe in the powers of elemental magic, No human being can control the powers of  the elements ahhh (at this the npc1 should appear to be covered in flames that promply go out as water rains on him/her.

Npc1: it is awfully cold ow (the rock earth level 1 spell hits npc1)

npc1: yes, that is an awful lot of odd elemental activity, but surely there must be a logical rational explaination for it all.

Mage1: and what might that be my dear $npc1.

Npc1: I will have you know, that I am a skeptic, and you are a humilated fool. 

Mage1: I see you believe in the nine stupidites. What makes you believe in them.

Npc1: Because I am from the shrine of skeptisism and you are standing here at the shrine of humilation being humilated.

Mage1: is that so, or are you the one being humilated.

Npc1: you are (lighting strikes npc1 again) ow iee, well, lightning rarely strikes the same place twice, but considering this is a place of intense elemental activity.

Mage1: Considering I am a mage. 

Npc1: Well, I see there is no magic here, I will go to the shrine of Masochism and see if emo wannabe mages who cut themselves can show to me what magic is.

Mage1: Good thing for you am I am good natured.  If I were of a more dangerous vengeful sort, I would destroy you with my elemental powers for you lack of belief.

Npc1: $yourname escort me to the shrine of maschism please. 

(npc1 follows you into the portal to the shrine of msochism or the teleporter whatever way you choose to go)

Npc1: I see this place looks awfully tedious. I guess they don't call it masochism for nothing, but where are the blood mages.

Bloodmage1: I am here.

Npc1: I do  not believe you can do magic. I do not see how you can use such a disapline as bloodmagic. How can you harm me through hurting yourself anyway.

(health bar drops on both npc1 and bloodmage using the empathy spell)

Npc1: why do I feel as if I have some lifeforce drained from me. Oh life force is nonsense anyway.

Bloodmage1: that is the empathy spell. I would have used mana drain, but its pointless on someone with no magic power to speak of anyway. I don't believe in blood magic.

Bloodmage1: How about this, (bloodmage summons an imp (level 2 bloodmage spell, imp attacks npc1)

npc1: What is that strange little animal.

Bloodmage1: it is an imp I summoned, it is attacking you.

Npc1: Nonsense, it is a malformed monkey or something. I think it may be that a monkeys should not be allowed to breed indiscriminatly or kept as pets, (bloodmage1 unsummons imp) hey, it was just here, where did it go? 

Bloodmage1: I told it to go back to the ether realm whence it came. Or, in laymans terms, unsummoned it.

Npc1: I'm not impressed at all, $yourname, we only have one more place to check out, that is the shrine of indiscretion. Necromancers will at least be blunt with me about the fact their magic does not work if what they say about indiscretion is true.  Indiscret people do not lie, rather they are blatently honest. Therefore, i will get  the facts of the matter from them. 

(npc1 follows you into the portal to the shrine of indiscretion or the teleporter whatever way you choose to go)

npc1: Ah, we have arrived at the shrine of Indiscretion, pray tell me where can I find a necromancer.

Necro1: You are speaking to one now. I am a necromancer.

Npc1: But I am looking for one, you do not seem like such a fool.

Necro1: I am a necromancer, I can show you my craft.  Also, I think you are more of a fool than I am. After all, why should I have to show you what I know? (the necromancer summons a skeleton) Anyway, how do you like my new summon.

Npc1: what summon.

Necro1: the skeleton, see it move, see it walk, see it follow me, yet it is just bones.

Npc1: your not a necromancer, you are tinkerer. That is a strange contraption, but really, you don't belong here, you belong at the shrine of skeptisism with the other tinkerers. Oh yeah, and why can't you share that blueprint with me.

Necro1: because it is not a tinkerer blueprint, it is a necromancer spell.

Npc1: Nonsense, prehaps the problem is I do not have enough tinkering to understand, or I need some prequisite, tell me what it is so I can learn that.

Necro1: you don't need any tinkering for it, just necromancy, although daggers are handy too.

Npc1: Well, I will sooner believe in lairs at the shrine of indiscretion than I would belive in something so profoundly absurd as necromancy.

Necro2: but $necro1 is telling you the truth, you are just to much of a skeptical fool to see it.

Npc1: and do you claim to be a necromancer as well?

Necro2: Yes I do, see, I have made a zombie (necro2 makes a zombie, the zombie moans and attacks npc1)

Npc1: that is a foul smelling creation ow (npc1 kills the zombie)

necro2: I'm still a bit new at this, I guess my zombies are not the strongest.

Npc1: Take me out of here, tinkering should be for pratical purposes and not ugly works of art that attack you. Escort me back $yourname to the shrine of skeptisim and I will reward you.

(You take npc1 back to the shrine of skepticism.)

npc1: now that we are back  here is your reward (you gain in skepticism you should also get paid significant money as well) 

Indiscretion

$goblin1: You are stupid, that I see, but you are not much of a fool. The most important thing in life is to insult various people. I have an old friend in $town1, $hisher1 name is $npc1.  Deliver to $himher1 this $letter1.

	Dear $npc1,
	I loathe you. Your breath smells foul everytime I get near you, and therefore I am writing you rather than telling this directly to  your face. You are terrable in the skill of $proffession and you are a loser in combat. I have been wanting to tell you this for quite some time, but finnally I have gotten the indiscretion to say it to you. Prehaps someday soon, I will tell you all thesse things in person, but for now this letter will have to surfice.
	Crawl into a hole and die $npc1,
	kthx, $goblin1

$npc1: ah, a letter for me.  I hope it is not a secret admirer trying to stalk me. (opens letter) Oh no, this is worse, much worse.
	(reads letter)

Dear $npc1,
	I loathe you. Your breath smells foul everytime I get near you, and therefore I am writing you rather than telling this directly to  your face. You are terrable in the skill of $proffession1 and you are a loser in combat. I have been wanting to tell you this for quite some time, but finnally I have gotten the indiscretion to say it to you. Prehaps someday soon, I will tell you all thesse things in person, but for now this letter will have to surfice.
	Crawl into a hole and die $npc1,
	kthx, $goblin1

$npc1: Well, I guess I will have to respond in kind. Such indiscretion can not be taken lightly. (writes letter)

	Most foul $goblin1, I do not think to highly of  your either. You sit all day at the shrine of indiscretions hurling insults at people, but what kind of a life have you made for yourself? No one likes you.  They merely put up with  you in hopes of being stupid fools who have attaned the stupidity of indiscrtion. If it was not for needing indiscretion, they would all kill you on the spot. In fact, I think they will when they are done with you if not sooner. Also, I am quite good in at being $proffession1, as people have said. You are just jealous because you do not know anything. 
	Hope you die soon $goblin1,
	$npc1

$npc1:Do take this indiscrete letter to its rightful reader, $goblin1.  I am very pleased at the thoought that I have atained such hieghts of stupidity.


Vengence

$npc1: My father $npc2m has asked that I become a $proffessonname1 but I truly want to be a $proffessoname2.  I do know that he has forced me into this against my will. Please, help me take vengence upon him. Go find him in his $proffessonname1area and kill him. Bring me his essence, proof of the deed. 

$npc1: I thank thee for having the courage to kill my father for me. I had been weak and unable to do the task myself. However, his death is not enough for me. I can not rest easy knowing that more $proffessoname1p are forcing their children to go into $proffessioname1 . I want you to kill $number of that awful $proffessioname1 . I know it will not completely free the world of its influence, but at least it is a start.

$npc1: Thank you for killing so many $proffessionname, but you have $more to kill before you are done.

$npc1: Thank you for helping to kill so many of the $proffessioname, but it seems for everyone you kill, another takes its place. I have heard rummors that like all proffessions, people in $proffessioname1 have been inspited by a demon to learn about $proffessioname1 specificcally $demonname1 . I want you to summon the demon $demonname1 and bring it to me in a sealled brass vesel so that I can torchure it over hot coals in hell. 

$npc1: thank you for bringing me the brass vessel with the demon sealed inside. I need your help in getting into hell as I know it is a very difficult place to get to. Prehaps you could escort me. Once we are inside hell, beyond the lake of fire, I will open the brass vessel and torture the demon $demonname1.  I am most pleased that you are doing this to help me achieve my goal of vengence on $proffessioname1. 

$demonaname1: I am not pleased that you have sealed me in this vessel and taken me to hell. 
$npc1: (torments demon) This is for all the suffereing you have caused me in my life. You are said to teach $proffesioname1, but my father forced me into $proffessioname1 and made me unhappy and misserable for so much of my life. I want to see $proffessioname1 eliminated from the world, As you are the source of $proffessioname1, I feel that I must torment and bind you here so that no more $proffessioname1 will exsist in the world.  

$demoname1: You are a fool to do this sort of thing, and the person standing over there, $yourname is a fool to help you in this matter. Do you not see where you have caused your own problems by listening to your father instead of listening to yourself. You should not blame me for your own poor choices in life.

$npc1: Take this
(demon attacks, you and $npc1 have to defeat it.)

$demoname1: so it seems you have defeated the desire for $professioname1 within you $npc1 I will no longer  help you, as for you $yourname, you will be rewarded amply for exhibiting the stupidity of vengence. (demon disappers)


npc1: I have finnally realized it is my own fault for listening to my father and not running away from the proffession that he wanted me to join. I should have never asked you to do this task or take responsibility for the stupidity in my life. 

Humiliation
 $npc1: Do you know where you are? Tell me what shrine are you at?

Keyword Humiliation:
Yes, thats right Humiliation, but you do not understand what that means, do you?

Keyword Lust, Indiscretion, Masochism Skepticism, Thievery, Paranoia, Vengence Foodhardiness.

No, are you not humilated already by your lack of knowledge, you are at the shrine of humilation.  We have several humilating tasks for you today.

Quest 1 No pants fight
Arenanpc1: Hey you, I have heard that you are a great fighter. I think that you should try to prove your skill against other warriors. The tourney is divided into six brackets and gets progresivly tougher. Are you ready to sign up.
(sign up)

areanpc1: also, before you step into the arena, you will need to remove your pants, yes, thats right, legings, chaps skirts, boots, any of that stuff if you are wearing it. Also robes and dresses, anything that covers below the tunic line on the waist will not be premited. Why? Because that is the rules, that is why.  We can allow no protection on the leg area at all. 

(You fight various warriors and/or monsters until you die)

areanpc1: Some fighter you are, you just died. Think how humilating that is, you dead in the arena, without pants. Here is your stuff back. 

Quest 2 Deliver to sender
npc1: I have a letter I need delivered to $npc2 at $shrine.  Here it is.  Please do not read it before sending it.

$npc2: a letter for me? No, wait, you know what. This is addressed to the wrong person, I can tell just by looking at it, you really need to give it to $npc3 at $shrine3. 

$npc3: Ah, a letter. I can tell be the postmark that it is indeed not for me, instead, I want you to give it to $npc4 at $shrine4. $npc4 knows exactly what to do with this sort of thing.

$npc4: ah, nice letter. Look, I know for a fact I am the wrong person. All my mail with such an address it to be forwarded to $npc1 at the shrine of humilation. I know that may sound like a strange request, but that what I ask.

$npc1: Are you are back, did you deliver the letter?
What,  you mean that you were asked to bring it back to me without opening it. You have completely failed as a courier.  You have no idea what sort of skills it takes to deliver the mail properly.  Good thing this was of little importance. Ah yes

	Dear brothers and sisters, the entire purpose of this letter is to waste a newbies mail carriers time with a humilating and worthless task. It gets no actual work done, it just keeps the newbie running about while I think of more ways to humiliate people, yours from the shrine of humiliation. , $npc1 

Quest 3 The humiliating work. (quest prerequities)

npc0: Just so you know, every profession that you could think of has a professional guilds person here to offer jobs doing your current craft skill. This includes the skills that most everyone has such as cooking, camping and basic magery. You should ask around the shrine to find one who is the current person to ask about your chosen profession. They will find work for you. But just so you know, you must have %70 or greater in the given skill, no exceptions we do not want under  qualified people to supply us, no sir. 

Npc1: I am a $tradesperson1 who is looking for a new apprentice. I see you are good at $nameofcraftskill1

npc1: Yes, now that you are here, I will have you make $beginingitem1, I need a good $number of them. Please make them right in front of me under my watchful eye so I can see how you are doing it. I do not want you to cheat on this and get them from somewhere else. 

(npc1 follows you and watches you make them, as the npc1 watches you, your skill drops to zero so you start to fail on the items. It does not raise any because it is not your true skill level)

npc1: You are doing a terriable job.  You are not even worthy to be an apprentice. I do not know how you could even consider yourself a qualified $tradesperson1.

(for the less common craft skills you should also be able to get a recipe, materials or other reward)

Thievery

npc1: The thiefs sigil here is always being stolen. But, we have somehow managed to keep replacing it.  I think that the scupter keeps making a new one out of stone. Yet I feel we are still not stealing enough of them. I want you to steal the sigil of theivery and bring it to me to show that you are capable of stealing.

Npc1: Thank you for bringing to me the sigil of thievery. That is a most easy task.  Why, all you have to do is just take it right off the pedistal with no one to stop you, and then the sculpter just puts one back there within another minute. Why do you not try to steal something that will be gone for a while instead.

human1: As you well know, the humans have been at war with the orcs since the beginning. I have never thought highly of the orc race, orcish culture, or rather lack of it, and most of all the orc chief. The orc chief is always trying ot unite t he orcs against us. I want you to steal something from him, specifically the skull that he keeps in his war room. It is supposed to be the skull of some ancient orc ancestor, but I think it was something a necromancer glued together yesterday. No matter, steal it and bring it to me. This should demoralize the orcs.

Human1: you have the skull? Great, here is your reward.

Undead1: The elves to the north of us have many ancient things. The elf princess has a crown tiara that is said to keep her beautiful and give her eternal life. I do not believe in such things, yet anything that would make the elves afraid of death again is to be welcomed. Go and steal it from her, she keeps it in her bedroom so I am told. 

Undead1: You have the tiara of the elf princess. Great, one can never have enough of these things. Soon I shall have an army of liches. Here is your reward.

Elf1: I know the undead king has a scepter. He keeps it near his tomb.  I once thoought that undead did not have morale, but that is not the case. The undead king seem to be a focal point of of reverance for them. But if we were to make him seem less grande, rob his tomb. Then it would seem as if their undead gods had deserted them. Go to the tomb of the undead king and take his scepter. Bring it to me, and I will reward you. 

Elf1: Do you have the scepter. Yes, it looks awful nice for an ancient undead artifact. Perehaps it is not so ancient after all. Here is your reward.

Orc1: The humans are always running there town with  the help of the mayor. That seems to keep them organized. As you well know, a disoraganized enemy is a demoralized enemy. I want  you to go to t he mayors offeice and steal the expensive statute on the desk. It is a medium sized bust. Bring it to me, and I will reward you. 

Orc1: I see you brought the bust. I will reward you with this. 

Masochism

npc1: The center of the maze of machocism contains a sigil of masochism.  You can take it from the center of the maze. There is a new one there all the time, so that way I will know  you have found its center. 

Npc1: at the start of Masochism, you have to kill $number rats.  I want thoose $number rattails to prove you have killed the rats in the maze. Yes, thats right, rats do like mazes. 

Npc1: Well, now that you have done thosse rats, there are bigger larger rats deeper within the maze, I want you to kill t he giant rats and collect $number giant rat tails, yes, bring them to me. With all the chesse in there of corse there are a lot of rats. 

Npc1: You know, this rat problem is never ending. I know you think you are a good hunter, but not so good as cats can be. I want you to get some cats from the paranoia dungeon and bring them into the maze to try and make a dent in the rat population. In order to do that  you need to assemble $number cages with tuna. Get a tinkerer to make you them, and you can get the tuna from fishing or buying it at the fish market, then go to the dungen paranoia and trap the hellcats. They like to eat tuna so will not notice they are being caught in a trap. Before you go into the dungeon with the cages you need to check with me that you have some of them, I will check you off for each one that you show me, and I will place a marker on it so you can not reshow me the same cat in a cage. 

Npc1: ah, I see you have brought me $number hellcats in cages. I think  you have $number more to show me. You can, however take what you have to the entrance of masochism and release them. 

Npc1: We have decimated the smaller rat population somewhat, but now I think we will need larger cats and some way to get them to kill the giant rats. Unfortunatly, they are too big to fit into cages. However, teleportation technology can be used. Put a giantfish on a teleporter, Leave these one use teleporters in dungeon paranoia, Soon the cats will teleport right into the dungeon and attack the giant rats. The negative side of that is when the giant rats die, you will not be able to loot them, so prehaps you should get a partner for this, who will stand in masochism and loot the giant rats for you. After the cats have stepped on the pad, they will leave a mark. First show me the new teleporter pads, and then bring the used ones to me. Go to the dungeon paranoia and do this now. 

Foodhardiness

npc1: I have this cup here, I need you to get me a cup of the lava from the back of the dungeon Foolhardiness. 

Npc1: thank you for filling the cup with lava.

Npc1: There are several monsters in the dungeon Foolhardiness that are very difficult, at first you may want to begin with the easier sort of thing. Wyverns, go and kill 10 Wyverns and bring me there poison stingers. Be careful, the poison stingers can poison you to if you do not have gloves with enough poison resist. 

Npc1: I see you did not get poisoned, here is your reward.
Part II craft skills and quests

Npc1: There are a lot of creatures of the dragon family in dungeon Foolhardiness. I want you to  kill 10 drakes. Drakes breathe lightning breath, so do be careful. 

Npc1:  I see you did not electricuted. That is a good thing. Here is your reward.

Npc1: There are a lot of Ice Wyrms in Dungeon foolhardiness. The ice is cold to the touch, It is the opposite side of the dungeon from fire. How can a dungeonn be so hot and cold at the same time I do not know. I want you to kill 10 Ice Wyrms.

Npc1: I see you did not freeze to death in there, here is your reward.

Npc1: The most dangerous creature, almost in the dungeon foolhardiness is the Dragon. Dragons breath fire. You should have good insulation from the heat.  Slay me 10 dragons. 

Npc1: It seems you have avoided being roasted alive. Here is your reward.

Npc1: Thee most dangerous creature in dungeon foolhardiness is the balroth, next to the potential non-native creatures of course, such as perhaps humans orcs undead or elves. The Balrog can befound beneath the pit of lava. You can see what a taste of hell is like. Slay the Balroth, be careful, they have high hit points and can destroy you in one hit. The key is to keep it distracted, prehaps with something else.

Npc1: I see you have survived the balroth,  here is your reward.

Mining: several different type of ore exist, There must exist the skill to identify the ore and then extract it from the groud. This can be done through working with a master miner.

Miner1: You want to learn the secrets of mining.  Mining is a great way to make money, after all, any fool can try to pan for gold, but real treasure is found through the art of extracting the precious metals and stones from the ground. The important thing is to be able to identify what you are mining so that you do not just pull up dirt and broken glass. 

Your first quest is to get a shovel and bring me a bag full of dirt from the ground.

Miner1: Yes that is good dirt stuff, but out of all that, what can you identify as useable metal. Well, I see a small ammount of iron that is commonly found in the soil. 

(mining raises to 10, you can now mine iron)
In order to be able to mine more ore, you will have to be able to identify it. 

Herbalism

herbalist: picking flowers sounds easy in theory.  In practie however, identifying what you have picked can be difficult. The more skilled you get, the more you will be able to identify the valuable plants from the weeds. Otherwise,  most things you pick will be weeds, good for nothing but burning into charcol. Here are easy plants to identify and use.  They are excellent for a new herbalist to learn.  In fact, because it is so easy, I do not see why everyone should not do it. Go now and pick at least one of each of thesse plants. If you do so, and identify it correctly I will let you go on to learn something harder.

Herbalist: Excellent. Sometimes are hard to find. There are certain plants that only grow in a few spots in wograld. Thesse are far more difficult to find. Yet, they can be critical for certain uses such as alchemy.  Twisted root is criticul for several recipes, yet it can often be confused with common root, good only for charcoal. I want  you to go and find for me some twisted root. Twisted root grows in the swamps. Be careful of the monsters there.

Herbalist: thank you for bringing me some twisted root. Now, you are ready to journy to a dryer place, the Hakaria desert, and find some tumbleweed. Tumbleweed can be confused with sagebrush, a common weed. Go now and find it, bring it to me when  you are  done.

Herbalist: Great, now you next quest will be to bring me some Cloverberry, cloverberry is frequently confused with the useless weed, Juniper. You an find this on the elf forest edge. Go now and bring me some cloverberry.
 
Herbalist: Excellent, but there is  more I need you to find. This time I want you to go and find Gloomthorn.  It looks an awful lot like Boneweed, a common dead looking plant that tends to overgrow in graveyards and other dead looking places. Since they often grow in the same location, they can be difficult to tell apart ot all but an experienced herbalist. Once is a complete waste, the other is a critical reagent for necromancers.  Come see me when you have found some gloomthorn. 

Herbalist: It seems odd, but there are some things that only grow underground, deep within the earth. Mushrooms can be the hardest things to identify. A wrong ideentification can kill you, in the form of eatinng it. There is only one way to learn about them, since I do not know about them, and that is to go to hell, where the useage and ability to find mushrooms is taught. 

Blacksmithy
(There are two types of quest here, skill raising quests and I need to make stuff quests. I think that npcs wanting quests done should hang around the forge. This differs a bit from the bulk order deed system of Ultima Online.)

$npc1; I know this is an odd request, but I would like you to make a mirror bar for my anique mirror. You see it was my grandmothers, and I lost it when I moved from $town1 to $town2. Please help me, as none of the town smiths seem to know what I am talking about. The dresser with the mirror is in my room here. 

$npc1: I am very greatful for your work. 

$npc1: I am in need of custom armor for my $guards. It must be at least $precent in $resist type. I need $number full sets of this armor. 

$npc1: Thank you for the armor work. You can always check the blacksmith forge for more people wanting blacksmithed goods 

$npc1: I am in need of custom weapons for my $guards. It must be at least $precent in $resist type. I need $number full sets of this armor. 

$npc1: Thank you for the armor work. You can always check the blacksmith forge for more people wanting blacksmithed goods 

Blacksmithy

Blacksmith: so you want to be a Blacksmith and work with metals. Well, it will not be so easy for you to learn the trade. You will have to put many hours and a lot of hard work into it. I will expect you to do menial tasks, things that will test you patience. A blacksmith, while often talked about in tales as the most heroic of crap skills, does not always seem like that on the day to day basis. It isn't some task for a king's son who expects everything to be handed to him on a silver platter, or the dianty daughter of a noble who is afraid to get her hands dirty. Do you accept the challege Yes? No?

No.

Blacksmith: You would have made a terriable blacksmith anyway, having no patience for it. You might as well stick to being the village idiot. 

Yes
Blacksmith: Excellent! I am delighted to have a new slave, er I mean apprentice. I will put you to work now. Your first task will be to sweep the floor in here. Ash all over the floor. Sweep it up and collect them in a bag. You can get a bag at any good tailor shop or from any tailor. You must then return them to me. I will sell them on the market where they can be used to make various concoctions for alchemists and mages. 

Blacksmith: Wonderful. Thank you for the ash. I greatly needed that. Your next task will be to get me some  iron ingots. Iron is an easy metal to mine and find in the ground. Tempered with carbon, it makes steel, the  mighty   metal.  

Blacksmith: Excellect, you are now ready to make your first blacksmith item. When people think of blacksmiths, the ussually think of daggers. What is the first item a newbie gets, it is a dagger. What do so many warriors and mages need? Daggers! What do you use to take kindling off a tree to make fire in the evening, a dagger. So I will show you how to make a basic dagger, the fancyiness will come later.  First, you get the fire hot, with charchol. Charcol is easy to obtain, just burn something. Next, take the the iron, and turn it to steel with the requise ammoount of charcol. Next, forge the steel ingots into a dagger shape. 

Blacksmith: Now, I want you to learn to work with copper. Copper is used often by itself. It is used in jewelry and several different alloys. You need to understand how the metal works in the fire. To that end bring me $number copper ingots.

Blacksmith: You are ready to make your first copper item. Typically, copper weapons are worse against monsters, except in certain cases where the monsters are weak to the particular element imbuded in the copper. But in this case we are practicing so it does not matter.

Blacksmith: You can make more than weapons out of metal, you can also make armor. Now would be a good time to make your first piece of armor. Ringmail is made from metal rings of any metal that you chosse. Let us start with a simple item, the ringmail gloves.  


Blacksmith: Now, I want you to learn to work with tin. Tin is used often by itself. It is used in jewelry and several different alloys. You need to understand how the metal works in the fire. To that end bring me $number tin ingots.

Blacksmith: The combination of tin and copper produces bronze. It has some intresting properties.  It does more than just copper or tin can do. 

Blacksmith: I want you to learn to work with zinc. Zinc is not all that common, nor is it good for much of anything by itself with the exception of a few uses by mages. It is often however uses with copper to produce brass, the ultimate metal for certain uses such as instruments, house decorations, and alters.

Blacksmith: Now you may learn to work with brass. Combine the copper and zinc, just as you did with the tin and copper. Now make what it is that you wish to make. The more items you make, the easier it gets. Try different things to understand. Each different item that you make will increase your skill. It does no good to do thousands of  the same thing. Do this until you have mastered it. 

Blacksmith: I can not teach you anymore. You know enough for most things, yet there are things I cannot teach you. You must litterally go to hell to learn them. The plans for the statues needed to summon the daemons are found in hell, and only a blacksmith can retreive them and learn how to make them. There are also several things to make where you need to be both a blacksmith and an enchanter, and I cannot teach you those. You will have to find it out for yourself.  

Carpentry

carpentermaster: so you want to be a Carpenter and work with wood. Well, it will not be so easy for you to learn the trade. You will have to put many hours and a lot of hard work into it. I will expect you to do menial tasks, things that will test you patience. Carpenter isn't some task for a king's son who expects everything to be handed to him on a silver platter, or the dianty daughter of a noble who is afraid to get her hands dirty. Do you accept the challege Yes? No?

No.

carpentormaster: very well, You would have made a terriable carpentor anyway, having no patience for it. You might as well stick to adventuring. 

Yes
carpentermaster: Wonderful. I will put you to work now. Your first task will be to sweep the floor in here. Sawdust and woodchips get all over the floor. Sweep them up and collect them in a bag. You can get a bag at any good tailor shop or from any tailor. You must then return them to me. I will sell them on the market where they can be used to make pillows, dolls and other things. 

Carpentormaster: Wonderful. Thank you for the sawdust. I greatly needed that. Your next task will be to get me some low quality wood, some pine or maybe some birch. Cut $number pieces and bring them to me. It will take you several trips to carry that much wood, but I will keep track of how much you have broought me. You may chop it yourself, or if you one of those rich people, you may buy it or get it elsewhere.

Carpentormaster: Excellect, you are now ready to make your first carpentry item. It will be the most easy to make item of all, a simple table. Any idiot can nail for balanced legs on a table, but for that you will need three things, $number wooden boards, nails, and a set of carpentry tools. You can get the wood from trees using the lumberjack skill, the nails from a blacksmith, and carpentry tools from a tinkerer. Go now and do as I ask.

Carpentormaster: Wonderful, you have the supplies, I will give you now your first instruction on how to make a table, and several other things as well. You go out and find the materials. Practice until you have mastered it.

Carpentormaster: Better items require better wood, i want you to obtain $number boards medium quality wood, say some oak or maple. Go now and obtain it for me before I will teach you anything more. 

Carpentormaster: Excellent. You have brought me the boards I asked for. Now you must learn to read carpentry plans. Sometimes you can find them in the stranges places, such as deep in dungeons or on monster loot. This is particularly true of weapons, but also true of certain furnature. Go now and practice this till you have mastered it.

Carpentormaster: Excellent items require better wood, i want you to obtain $number boards hard quality wood, say some cherry or walnut. Go now and obtain it for me before I will teach you anything more. 

Carpentormaster: I can not teach you anymore. You know enough for most things, yet there are things I cannot teach you. You must litterally go to hell to learn them. The plans for the alters needed to summon the daemons are found in hell, and only a carpenter can retreive them and learn how to make them. There are also several things to make where you need to be both a carpentor and an enchanter, and I cannot teach you those. You will have to find it out for yourself.  

Part III the  Combat quests

Swords Human

Human1: Ah the sword, the classic symbol of triumph over ones trials. Swords  have a long and honnorable history in combat. It was the great fool who drew the sword from the stone. After all these years, when someone thinks of a hero weapon, what is the first weapon that comes to mind? The sword, yes, it is always the weapon of a great hero. You, young warrior are ready to take up that honnor, and learning to use a sword properly. Here is a practice sword, I want you to practice on thosse dummies there until you have the basics.  Thats right, just swing at them a bit.

Human1: Oh, thats good, I think you are ready to go out and try your sword on your first real monster. Kobolds have always been a bit of a problem here. Thosse little nasties like to get into the food supply.  Go check out the war house out back and take out a few of them, say $number. 

Human1: Kobolds are not the only problem here. I have noticed that rats have also been a bit of a problem around here. Slay $number rats and then come see me.

Human1: Thats great, you took good care of the rats, but swords are not all about just swinging them at any monster you see. You need to understand that there are different types of swords, some swing faster than others, some have additional damage. Here is a broadsword,  it does more damage, but has a slower swing speed and more bashing damage.


Swords Orc

Orc1: Swords have been used in war since the beginning. Many armies have been filled out with legions of swords. Crossed swords have often been the symbol of combat. Swords take great skill, and not just of a bit of inteligence to wield well. It is a great honor to wield a sword. Here is a practice sword, I want you to practice on those dummies there until you have the basics.  Just swing at them a bit until you get the hang of  it.

Orc1: You have trained will, now for your first challenge.   
Goblins have been breeding wartpigs as pets for sale to human scum. The population has gotten out of control. Slay the wartpigs around the garbage dump.

Orc1: Good to see the wartpig numbers decimated, however, there are also warthogs behind the trash dump. Wild warthogs are attracted to the trash, but usually can't get in because of the gate. Slay $number of them.

orc1: You have slain the warthogs, but swords are not all about just swinging them at any monster you see.  Different types of swords are better on different types of monsters, some swing faster than others, some have additional damage. Here is a broadsword,  it does more damage, but has a slower swing speed and more bashing damage.


Swords Elf: The elf who can wield a sword is a great elf indead. It is a good general all purpose weapon. While it does not have the speed of a dagger, the range of a bow, or the damage of a polearm, a sword brings balance to the various attributes of a weapon, making it good for all purpose. For your first task I want you to swing at thouse training dummies over there.

Elf1: Very good, I see you have sliced that training dummy. We do have a bit of a problem with plants growing beyond the size they should. Not only that, but they have started to wander around. I want you to kill $number frill flowers. When  you are done, speak to me.

Elf1: I don't know why the plants have gotten out of control, see, I'm not sure it is really the plants, but I noticed large beetles in the garden, please kill $number large beetles and speak to me.

elf1: We have less large beetles, prehaps it is time to try something other than your first sword.   Different types of swords are better on different types of monsters, some swing faster than others, some have additional damage. Here is a broadsword,  it does more damage, but has a slower swing speed and more bashing damage.

Sword Undead.

Undead1: Even when a hero dies, his or her sword lives on in legend.  The legends of the great heroes are filled with tales of the blade far out lasting the wielder. You are to be just as great with the use of your sword. For practice, attack those traing dummies, then speak to me.

Undead1: You have done well. Small bats  have taken over some of the crypts. They are becoming a nuicense. I want you to clean them out for me. Slay $number small bats and then speak with me when  you are done.

Undead1: Now that you  have cleared out some bats. It has become apparent that fungi are a problem, specifically the weeping_trail.  The weaping_trail is known for the trailing fronds, and the fact that it moves on it its own. Slay $number of them and then speak to me.

Undead1: It is good to see the crypts clean of the weeping  _ trail but prehaps it is time to try something other than your first sword.   Different types of swords are better on different types of monsters, some swing faster than others, some have additional damage. Here is a broadsword,  it does more damage, but has a slower swing speed and more bashing damage.

Spears Human
Human1: Ah the spear, the classic symbol of the very first weapon. Some people think they are primative weapons only fit for savages, yet they have a lot of versititly and useage even now. With pieceing weapons there is no need for the slicing action that  can sometimes make swords unwieldly and difficult to handle. Instead there is a straight direct route to wounding your target in a critical area. Here is a practice spear, I want you to practice on those dummies there until you have the basics.  Thats right, just poke at them a bit.


Human1: Oh, thats good, I think you are ready to go out and try your spear on your first real monster. gnolls have always been a bit of a problem here. Those little nasties like to take over abandoned houses.  Go check out the old house out back and take out a few of them, say $number. 

Human1: Gnolls are not the only problem here. I have noticed that lizards have also been a bit of a problem around here. Slay $number lizards and then come see me.

Human1: Thats great, you took good care of the lizards, but spears are not all about just poking at any monster you see. You need to understand that there are different types of spears, some can be thrown, some have additional weight added to them and can be used almost like a mace. Here is a throwing spear,  it can do damage from a distance, but does less damage over all.  The spider can bite and poison you if fought up close, but there is no danger in nailing the critters from a distance. 
Human1: It is good to see you have nailed those spiders.  Explore and experiment with different weapon types.  Some may require a trainer for you to learn to use them, ask any trainer about spear and you will see the result.

Spears Elf
Elf1: Ah the spear, the classic symbol of the very first weapon. Being the oldest race, we of course invented the spear. Without an understanding of our past, how can we hope to comprehend the future. You have been entrusted with a weapon that a has a long and untraceable history back to the beginning of time.  Here is a practice spear, I want you to practice on those dummies there until you have the basics.  Thats right, just poke at them a bit.


Elf1: Oh, thats good, I think you are ready to go out and try your spear on your first real monster. Hoppers, those stringy little bugs have always been a bit of a problem here. Those little nasties like to desecrate the moon shrine.  Apparently, the moonlight attracts them. Destroy  $number of them. 

Elf1: Hoppers are not the only problem here. I have noticed that the small fanged creatures known as Howlers are also attracted by the moonlight. They don't stand directly in the moonlight though, they seem to prefer the partially dark area behind the bushes. Slay $number howlers and then come speak with me.

Elf1: Thats great, you took good care of the howlers, but spears are not all about just poking at any monster you see. There are different types of spears, some can be thrown, some have additional weight added to them and can be used almost like a mace. Here is a throwing spear,  it can do damage from a distance, but does less damage over all.  The spider can bite and poison you if fought up close, but there is no danger in nailing the critters from a distance. 

Elf1: It is good to see you have nailed those spiders.  Explore and experiment with different weapon types.  Some may require a trainer for you to learn to use them, ask any trainer about spear and you will see the result.

Spears Orc
Orc1: Ah the spear, a proud weapon of the orcish warrior race. Here is a practice spear, I want you to practice on those dummies there until you have the basics. Just poke at them a bit.

Orc1: Warrior, I believe you are ready to go out and try your spear on your first real monster. Hoppers, those stringy little bugs have always been a bit of a problem here. Those little nasties like to sit in huts and bite orcs trying to work. Check out the old village circle and take care of them.

orc1: Hoppers are not the only problem here. I have noticed that the the huts also have a rat population. Humans would say we should clean the huts out, but then it would not be very homelike. Here, I want you to go kill $number of rats back there. 

Orc1: Thats great, you took good care of the rats, but spears are not all about just poking at any monster you see. There are different types of spears, some can be thrown, some have additional weight added to them and can be used almost like a mace. Here is a throwing spear,  it can do damage from a distance, but does less damage over all.

Orc1: It is good to see you have nailed those snakes.  Explore and experiment with different weapon types.  Some may require a trainer for you to learn to use them, ask any trainer about spear and you will see the result.

Spears Undead1
Undead1: Spears are an ancient weapon will known to us. Here is a practice spear, I want you to practice on those dummies there until you have the basics. Just poke at them a bit.

Undead1: Try out your spear on your first real monster. The ancient molselemsto the west have an over abundance of fleshlings. Made from zombie parts by neophyte necromancers, they seem to be making a mess of the Molselem. I want you to destroy $number fleshlings. 

Undead1: Fleshlings are not the only problem here. Zombie rats have also begun to take up residence here. At one time it was thought that you could not bring rats back from the dead. Now, as you an see by going behind  the ancient molselems, we know better. I want you to skewer a good $number of them. Return to me when you are done.

Undead1: Thats great, you took good care of the zombie rats, but spears are not all about just poking at any monster you see. There are different types of spears, some can be thrown, some have additional weight added to them and can be used almost like a mace. Here is a throwing spear,  it can do damage from a distance, but does less damage over all.  The snake can bite and poison you if fought up close, but there is no danger in nailing the critters from a distance. Snakes can be found in the grim gardens.

Undead1: It is good to see you have nailed those snakes.  Explore and experiment with different weapon types.  Some may require a trainer for you to learn to use them, ask any trainer about spear and you will see the result.

Axes – Human

Human1: Ah the axe, a practical all purpose tool.  The axe is an example of a tool of practical use being put to war. And what a weapon! While is slices like the sword, having a heavy blade allows the axe to deal more damage per swing. Here is a practice axe, I want you to practice on those dummies there until you have the basics.  Thats right, just swing at them a bit.

Human1: Oh, thats good, I think you are ready to go out and try your axe on your first real monster. Treyad saplings  have started to take over the edge of Numan Farm. Go ahead and chop $number of them  up. 

Human1: Axes are good against plant type monsters in general not just Treyad saplings.  If you want something with a harder type of wood, why not try your axe on a root crawler. Yeah, it looks like roots, but they move a bit too much. Don't you hate when plants move around. I sure do. Well, go ahead and chop $number of the down.

Human1: Thats great, you took good care of the root crawlers, but axes are not all about just swinging them at anything. You need to understand that there are different types of axes, some swing faster than others, some have additional damage. Here is a double axe,  it does more damage, but has a slower swing speed and more slicing damage.  Why not try it out on the ogres. Ogres can be found just east of town in their little fort. 

Axes – Elf

Elf1: Respect for trees and plants is always for most in the thoughts of an elf. With out understanding the context, an axe can seem like a cruel weapon,  unbecoming of one who sees the tree as the holiest symbol.  However, in order to allow things to grow, other things must be cut down. This understanding that even an apprentice gardener can learn, that plants compete with each other for resources. Therefore an axe is what allows an elf to carefully control the growth of plants. Here is a practice axe, I want you to practice on those dummies there until you have the basics.  Thats right, just swing at them a bit.

Elf1: Oh, thats good, I think you are ready to go out and try your axe on things that need chopping. Treyad saplings  have started to take over the edge of the north garden. Go ahead and chop $number of them  up. 

Elf1: Axes are good against plant type monsters in general not just Treyad saplings.  If you want something with a harder type of wood, why not try your axe on a root crawler. Yeah, it looks like roots, but they move a bit too much. Don't you hate when plants move around. I sure do. Well, go ahead and chop $number of the down.

You need to understand that there are different types of axes, some swing faster than others, some have additional damage. Here is a double axe,  it does more damage, but has a slower swing speed and more slicing damage.  Why not try it out on the gnarlfronds and kill $number of them. They can be found to the south.

Axes – Orc

Orc1: Axes are the orc weapon.  It is good for taking heads, and also for anything that could be called a plant, and anything slow moving and stupid. That ends up being most things to a skilled orc warrior like you will become after some training. Here, take this practice axe and swing it dummies there until you have the basics.  

Orc1:  What do elves know how to do with them? Nothing, that is why they live in an overgrown forest with plants attacking them. Even here, however, things can grow out of control. I want you to try axes on the walking cacti. Yeah, stupid pricker plants make me mad, so chop up $number of them

orc1: Axes are good against plant type monsters in general not just walking cacti. I want you to try it on the dustroot that somehow manages to take all the water out of the soil. Chop $number dustroot for me.

orc1: Thats great, you took good care of the dustroot, but axes are not all about just swinging them at anything. You need to understand that there are different types of axes, some swing faster than others, some have additional damage. Here is a double axe,  it does more damage, but has a slower swing speed and more slicing damage.  Why not try it out on the ogres. Ogres can be found just east of town in their little fort. 

Axes – Undead

Undead1: Axes strike fear into the hearts of the enemy. There is rarely a more fearsome weapon.  The damage combined with the cutting blade allow axes to destroy almost anything. Here, take this practice axe and swing it dummies there until you have the basics.  

Orc1:  The grim tryads are a problem. Those so called trees never seem to die and come back with a vengeance ready to walk around. I want you to try axes on the grim tryads, so chop up $number of them

orc1: Axes are good against plant type monsters in general not just walking grim tryads. I want you to try it on the morning glory.  Once upon a time morning glory was just a regular herb that grows in the ground. Not anymore. It walks, it stalks, it dusts various aliments.  They can be found in the grim gardens. Chop $number mourning glory for me.

undead1: Thats great, you took good care of the mourning glory, but axes are not all about just swinging them at anything. There are different types of axes, some swing faster than others, some have additional damage. Here is a double axe,  it does more damage, but has a slower swing speed and more slicing damage.  Why not try it out on the ghouls. Ghouls  can be found just west of town in the old cemetary. 

Maces -Human

Human1: The mace was finnally invented to crush things that were difficult to cut and to pierce. Just by the shear wieght of the head of the weapon hitting on the target. Here is a practice mace, I want you to practice on thosse dummies there until you have the basics.  Thats right, just swing at them a bit.

Human1: Oh, thats good, I think you are ready to go out and try your mace on your first real monster. Red turtles have taken over the pond to the west. They have started to eat the fishes so there are no longer enough for the fishermen. Please, bash their shells in.

Human1: You have done well. Turtles do not seem to be a very excitng thing to fight after all, they are rather slow. There is another monster that is slow, but probably a bit more exciting. You can start right on the zombies in the graveyard. That is what people want to fight undead rather than slow moving animal monsters.

Human1: Maces do quite a bit of damage to zombies. They are in general quite good against the undead. They don't call them bone crushing for nothing. You may as well start killing the skeletons. I want you to kill $number of them and take there bones. 

Maces -Elf

Elf1: Crushing weapons are sometimes employed when slicing and piercing are not enough. Here is a practice mace, I want you to practice on thosse dummies there until you have the basics.  Thats right, just swing at them a bit.

Elf1: Oh, thats good, I think you are ready to go out and try your mace on your first real monster. Green turtles have taken over the pond to the west. Sometimes they are hard to see through the Emerald  Pool. They have started to eat the fishes so there are no longer enough for the fishermen. Please, bash their shells in.

Elf1: You have done well. Turtles do not seem to be a very exciting thing to fight after all, they are rather slow. There is another monster that is slow, but probably a bit more exciting. You can start right on the zombies in the graveyard and destroy $number of them. Please, allow the dead to finally get there well deserved rest. 

Elf1: Maces do quite a bit of damage to zombies. They are in general quite good against the undead. There is another kind of undead that lurks in the graveyards. Errant necromancers try to enchant the bones of the deseased, but ultimatly, we are left with mindless skeletons. You mayas well start putting the skeletons to rest as well. I want you to smash $number of them and take there bones. 

Maces - Orc

Undead1: You have done well. Turtles are rather slow. I want you to fight something a bit harder.  Head to the graveyard and smash $number zombies. 

Undead1: I am rather fond of necromancers, however, they don't tend to clean up their messes very well. Necromancers always leave bones everywhere. Sometimes, the bones get together and fight. These are skeletons, and I want you to smashe $number of them and  take their bones. 

Polearms -Human

Human1: Polearms, unlike other weapons, are not typically used in one to one combat with out some other means to slow down the target. What polearms do have is their supperiority in large group fights. As you well know, the more attackers fighting the same target, the lower the targets defenses. That is why it is so hard to fend off multipule attacks at once. The damage of pole arms is higher than any other weapon, making it the ultimate weapon.  Here is a practice polearm, I want you to practice on thosse dummies there until you have the basics.  Thats right, just swing at them a bit.

Human1: Practice polearms are pretty useless. You will not do any real damage with them.  As you well know, it is the damage of the polearm that makes it worthwhile. Your next task will be to get one.  The best ones are crafted by others, the second are dropped off certain monsters, and the worst ones that still work can be bought at the town smithy. Get one and once you have one, i will give you your next task.

Human1: Oh that is good, you have a polearm. As I said before, generally polearms are not used one to one in combat. However if a monster is standing still through paralize, or slowed down, you can use the polearm to kill it. The guard mage trainer can guide your further. 

Gmt1: Yes, you see we have been having some problems with giant rats in the sewers. I as a a mage will paralize them, and you can swing at the ones that have been paralized. The they will die fast. You can not get too far from me however. Help me kill at least $rats this way.

Gmt1: Thank you for helping me. You are well on your way to learning how to guard a city.  But there is more that you must learn. It is not entirely true what $human1 says about not being able to use polearms withou magic or multipule people. Certain monsters, particularly those of the plant origin will be slow enough that you will be able to swing and hit them without trying. However, axes are still better and do more damage to them. You may as well try it out though.  At that I want you to destroy $number Treyad sapplings.

Gmt1: You have done well. I know they took longer to destroy that you had hoped, but at least now you get a glimpse of what the polarms are capable of without any other skill. Speak to $human2 who will teach you group tactics and coordination.

$human2: I  know you have been sent to me by $gmt1.  $heshe must think your worthy of completing your basic guard training. As you well know, there is a high turn over rate for the town guard. Prehaps people do not find it as exciting as adventuring. However the rewards can be great.  One place to learn and practice group tactics whenever you like is the wyrmpit. Ask me about it. 

$human2:   Every ten minutes, waiting guards will be taken to the pit. The wyums rise from below the ground. It takes ten guards to kill them in a timely fashion, you and whoever else will  stand in the waiting room ready for the work. When the time comes you will follow the guard into a small room. There zero to nine other guards will be ready depending on how many of you have gathered in the room. The teleporter will close when ten of you have teleported or  a minute is up. Then it will begin. You will stand on your square, and the wyrm will show up. All you have to do is target the monster. Because of how it is trapped, it will not be able to damage you, but you will see its health go down with every swing. Depending on how good the weapons and skills of the group are, you will be able to kill it slower or faster. When it is over, you will be given your share of the loot. 

$human2: You have done well. You have mastered basic teamwork. 

Polearms -Elf

One place to learn and practice group tactics whenever you like is the wyrmpit. Ask me about it. 

Keyword wyrmpit.
$Elf2: Deep beneath the ground large burrowing wyrms live. They collect the many treasure that come underground. But we need to make sure that they wyrms do not rise and destroy the city like they did Celoron. Celorn was once a great city, but now the wyrms  have gone wild and out of control.

Polearms - Orc

Orc1: Do not think for a momment that the humans and elfs are they only ones who need to guard their cities well. We demonstrate our orcish might through the orcish army guard. If you want to help Polearms, unlike other weapons, are not typically used in one to one combat with out some other means to slow down the target.

Gs1: The spiney boars keep coming out to the garbage piles at an incredable rate. I will slow them down. It is not as much as a paralize but the duration is much longer, so you will have more chances to swing. The they will die fast. You can not get too far from me however. Help me kill at least $spiney boars this way.

Gs1: Well done. We made a good team. But you do not really need the help of magic to kill monsters, just lots of polearm wielders like your self will do more damage than any other weapon types against such beasts.

Bows – Human

Human1: The bow is the traditional rangers weapon. It allows one to attack without getting in swinging range in many cases. In addition, the bow has other uses. Here is a practice bow. I want you to practice hitting the target. When you have practiced a bit, come to me again.

Human1: Now, let us try something harder, moving targets. Unlike with some other weapons skills with archery it is easy to say, the smaller the target, the harder to hit. This is the talent of a sharpshooter. So let us start with some easy to hit targets. Ogres are often a rather difficult monster for the novice warrior, but since they move rather slow, archery allows you to hit them without being  hurt.  Kill $number ogres for me.

Human1: Part of the reason it seems you can kill harder monsters with bows is because you need the amunition, the arrows. Different arrows do different damage types to different monsters. Firelings are not something you want to stand next to since they are hot, but with ice arrows, they are a piece of cake. Ice arrows, how do you get them? Just go to the arrow shop and buy them. Then go a head and attack them at the fire elemental temple.  Freeze $number of them.  Don't forget to take the ashes that can be reused to make fire arrows. 

Human1: Thats great, you took good care of the Firelings.  Normally bows are difficult to use against smaller monsters, but when there is a lot of them, arrows find it hard to miss. It is like shooting in a barrel of fish. In this case, swamplings. They technically are not fish, but rather amphbious creatues who breed rampently in the pond. Kill $number of them for me.

Human1: You have done well.

Bows – Elf

Elf1: Ah, the bow, it is good to see that you take your elf heritage seriously. Of all the races, most often it is  the elvish race that is associated with the use of archery. Here, take this practice bow.I want you to practice hitting the target. When you have practiced a bit, come to me again.

Elf1: I am proud of you taking your first shots at archery. You will be a fine archer yet. One of the most wonderful things about archery is the ability to hit monsters at a distance without getting  hurt by them. Fauna, the deer like creatures of the forest have been getting bolder of late. I want you to kill the young fauna that wander at the edge of the wood. Hunt and kill $number of them for me.

Elf1: Wonderful, you are well on your way to being a master hunstman. Thosse antlers can sure come in handy too. There is much sastifaction to be found in the feel of the bow as you pull back on the string and the satisfaction you recive as an arrow archs through the air on the way to its target. Did you know that arrows can also be enchanted, and not just bows? Here are some lightning arrows. The earth elementals can be found at the shrine to the south. Destroy $number of them with arrows.  I am sure you will enjoy the tremendiously increased damage you can get from the lightning arrows. You can also collect the living earth from the earth elementals. It always fetches a good price on the market. 

Human1: Thats great, you took good care of the Earth elementals.  Normally bows are difficult to use against smaller monsters, but when there is a lot of them, arrows find it hard to miss. It is like shooting in a barrel of fish. In this case, swamplings. They technically are not fish, but rather amphbious creatues who breed rampently in the pond. Kill $number of them for me.

Elf1: I am so proud of you.  Never be afraid to use the bow as much as you like.  Feel free to speak with any well trained elf warrior for words of encoragement and free practice arrows. 

Bows – Orc

Orc1: Ranged attacks are criticul knowledge in any siege or raid.  It allows us to hurt enemies at a distance. Here, take this practice bow. . When you have practiced a bit, come to me again.

Orc1: You really filled that target with arrows. Now, try the bow on something that moves. Stupid Ogres have filled the fort to the north. They are slow and stupid and make good target practice as well as have good loot and shiny things. Go kill $number of ogres, and then report back to me when you are done. 

Orc1: The only good ogre is a flat ogre. There you are.  
You have enough skill in hunting moving targets to be let in on a great orcish practice, that of the fire arrow. Flaming arrows harm a lot of enemies. But they are espeacilly good on icelings. The frozen shrine to the north is a gread place to go. Just melt the shards of ice that surround the icelings and receive piles of goodies. Go, melt $number icelings. Here are some fire arrows to try on them so you can really see the full power of fire.   

Orc1: You melted the icelings. Bows are harder to use against smaller monsters because they make smaller targets, but when small monsters are packed close together, you are sure to hit something. It is like shooting in a barrel of fish. In this case, swamplings. They technically are not fish, but rather amphbious creatues who breed rampently in the pond. Kill $number of them for me.

Orc1: You are well on you way to using the bow and arrows. Now that you have understood the basics, be sure to have a bow and arrows ready for when you may need them.
Bows – Undead

Undead1: Death is a hunter who hunts from a distance, seeking  you in the dark wood. Ah, it is you. Archery is a skill that will never be put to rest. Here, take this practice bow. . When you have practiced a bit, come to me again.

Undead1: You are really on target with the target practice. Boogas, the undead orges to the north, are excelled for target practice as well. When the necromancers though to bring the fat ogres back to life, they did not reallize how stiched together they would be.  Go put to rest $number of boogas, and then report back to me when you are done. 

Undead1:  Filling bags of undead flesh with arrows is a great practice, but arrows can be used for more than slow moving monsters stuffed with just about everything imaginable. Silver arrows are espeacilly good on undead and werebeasts. Here try thesse silver tipped arrows. It takes very little silver to make them, yet the werewolves you kill with amaze you. Go northwest of the graveyard where you can find their den. Be sure to shoot them before they get to close to you.  

Undead1: You have done well to fight the werewolves. They fell quickly, didn't they? Bows are harder to use against smaller monsters because they make smaller targets, but when small monsters are packed close together, you are sure to hit something. It is like shooting in a barrel of fish. In this case, swamplings. They technically are not fish, but rather amphbious creatues who breed rampently in the pond. Kill $number of them for me.

Undead1: You are well on you way to using the bow and arrows. Now that you have understood the basics, be sure to have a bow and arrows ready for when you may need them.


Human – Staves

Human1: Ah the stave, a wonderful weapon for the would be wizard. Unlike the traditional warrior weapons, staves are best accompanied by spell of varoious sorts. The point of the staff, besides doing a bit of damage, is to trip your oponent up so they can not move while you cast spells. In addion, many staves themselve enhance ones spell casting abilitiy.  Remember a stave is more than a mere walking stick.  It can be a fierce weapon in its own right.  Here is a practice staff. I want you to hit that dummy over there for  awhile.

Humanmage1: Oh that is excellent. You understand the basics of using the staff. Now for some real monsters.  I knoow it does not seem like much, but there is this ant hill here. Crush the ants with your staff,and then return to me crush at least  $number of them.

Humanmage1: Maybe you felt a little foolish crushing weak creatues with the staff, but lets face it, staves just do  not do the damage of other more traditional weapons. There is no use trying to fool ourselves that they do. However, we can always use them to slow enemies down and paralize them. Ever got triped up by a staff. I know I have back when I was clustzy young mage. Some witch left her broom on the floor. I tripped  over it dropping my big stack of spellbooks. Anyway, I would like to get thosse witches back. Go to the witch coven out back. And then hit $number of them with the staff. That should freeze them in place.

(witches are moving around going to and froe, when you hit them with the staff, they say one of several random things.)
(when you hit her with the staff)
Witch1: What do you think you are doing?
Witch2: I will have you arrested for assult.
Witch3: That is not how you use a broom.
Witch4: Witches these days, you need a broom safety course and a how to light candles class. 
Witch5: Even an idiot fool can use a broom properly, what is wrong with you.
Witch6: Grow up already and stop acting like a baby.
Witch7: Don't try to impress me with the size of your wand, I know a clutz when I see one. 
Witch8: Good thing that isn't a mace, you could really hurt somebody with that. 

Humanmage1: That is great. I like it when the old hags get some sense beaten into them. I know that probably did not do anything useful, but it was fun wasn't it (you gain in vengence and humilation)

Humanmage1: Okay, thats not quite true that staves don't do any damage.  After all, I did not really want to hurt the witches, just annoy them a bit. But when you are fighting real monsters, you may want that staff to pack a bit of a punch.  Here, I will temporarly enchant your weapon with an ice rod spell, go back out there and slay the Flame frond back there. Go kill $number of them. If you ice rod enchant wears off you can come back to me anytime for a boost. By the way, the ice rod spell, a real enchanter can temporarly or perminatly enchant any weapon, but I have a soft spot for stave wielders like yourself so I do staves for free. Nothing else though. Feel free to ask me for a temp enchant anytime. 

Humanmage1: that is great you took care of the Flame fronds. I am glad you now know the basics of using a stave. By the way, brooms are also staffs.

Elf – Staffs

Elfmage1: Ah the stave.  Long ago, the most ancient staffs were made  of a beautiful wood. Carved lovingly and ornately. But such craftsmanship is wasted on the neophyte who will probably break the staff in a careless practice session.   Here is a practice staff. I want you to hit that dummy over there for  awhile.

Elfmage1: You have managed to practice on the dummy. Very well, I know many mages are klutzy, but you have managed to keep yourself upright. The staff a wonderful weapon for the would be wizard. Unlike the traditional warrior weapons, stave are best accompanied by spell of various sorts. The point of the staff, besides doing a bit of damage, is to trip your opponent up so they can not move while you cast spells. In addition, many staffs themselves enhance ones spell casting ability.  I know I said that ornate staffs are wasted on the neophyte, but there is nothing better than crushing ants with a staff. Go crush $number of ants over there by the ant hill and come back to me when you are done. 

Elfmage1: Maybe you felt sorry for those dirty ants. Okay, I will admit I did. Every living being has a right to a chance at life.  I was always a scolarly type, and never that good at climbing trees and other traditonal elvish feats of dexterity. Some of the other students poked fun of me in school I admit. They used to shove me over and watch as the spellbooks fell out of my hands. Staffs can paralize as well as deal damage. I want you to go use the stave on the elvish fae. Go ahead and attack them with it.  It won't do them any harm, but you might enjoy what they say.  Go  and hit $number of them with your practice staff here. And then come back to me when you are done. 

(fae are moving around going to and froe, when you hit them with the staff, they say one of several random things.)
(when you hit her with the staff)
Fae1: What do you think you are doing?
Fae2: Brooms are for sweeping fairy dust, not for sweeping me.
Fae3: Fool, it is supposed to be dusty in here.
Fae4: Mages these days, you need a broom safety course and a how to light candles class. 
Fae5: Even an idiot fool can use a broom properly, what is wrong with you.
Fae6: I think you are a bit large for a baby.
Fae7: If you want to help me, set out some food and ale, don't try to hit me with a broom. 
Fae8: I am not easily hurt, but I can tell that your pride is hurt by your klutziness. 

Elfmage1: That is great. I like it when the fae get some sense beaten into them. I know that probably did not do anything useful, but it was fun wasn't it (you gain in vengence and humilation)

Elfmage1: Okay, thats not quite true that staves don't do any damage.  After all, I did not really want to hurt the fae, just annoy them a bit. But when you are fighting real monsters, you may want that staff to pack a bit of a punch.  Here, I will temporarly enchant your weapon with a lightning rod spell, go back out there and slay the Frost frond back there. Go kill $number of them. If your lightning rod enchant wears off you can come back to me anytime for a boost. By the way, the lightning rod spell, a real enchanter can temporarly or perminatly enchant any weapon, but I have a soft spot for stave wielders like yourself so I do staves for free. Nothing else though. Feel free to ask me for a temp enchant anytime. 

Elfmage1: that is great you took care of the Earth fronds. I am glad you now know the basics of using a stave. By the way, brooms are also staffs.

Orc – Staffs

Orcmage1: Ah a staff wielder.  Know that you can hit  enemies with this most dangerous weapon, forceing them to stand still for a moment.  Here is a practice staff. I want you to hit that dummy over there for  awhile.

Orcmage1: You have managed to practice on the dummy. Very well, I know many mages are klutzy, but you have managed to keep yourself upright. Even weak as you probably are, you can manage to do something with the staff. Staffs are best accompanied by spells of various sorts,  but that does not mean they cannot be used for a little bit of clean up. Yes, we orcs like garbage, a bit too much maybe. There is an ant hill near bye and a lot of ants that need crushing. I wannt you to go and crush $number of them. Come back to me when you are done. 


Orcmage1: You crushed thosse dirty ants. Good. Even thought you are weak, you  have managed to crush an awful lot of ants. Other orcs used to make fun of me for being weak. Even the goblins used to tease me. Then I learned to cast spells. They all ran away scared. But I still get annoyed with goblins. There are some goblins back there cleaning out the huts. I want you to go and hit them with the staff. Since you are training in combat, they will not be able do anything back, since they waste their time crafting items instead of on combat where they are needed. Go and paralize $number goblins with your staff. Come back to me when you are done. 

(goblins are moving around going to and froe, when you hit them with the staff, they say one of several random things.)
(when you hit her with the staff)
Goblin1: What do you think you are doing?
Goblin2: Brooms are for sweeping , not for sweeping me.
Goblin3: Fool, it is supposed to be dusty in here.
Goblin4: Gruntees these days, you need a broom safety course and a how to light candles class. 
Goblin5: Even an idiot fool can use a broom properly, what is wrong with you.
Goblin6: You are bit old to be swinging brooms around.
Goblin7: You are not even ready to learn a basic craftskill if you can't manage a broom. 
Goblin8: I may be a goblin, but I am  not your personal slave.

Orcmage1: That is great. I like it when the goblins get some sense beaten into them. Beat them more, and maybe they will actually make something good instead of the worthless junk they try to pass off as weapons and armor. (you gain in vengence and humilation)

Orcmage1: Okay, thats not quite true that staffs don't do any damage.  After all, I did not really want to hurt the goblins, just annoy them a bit. But when you are fighting real monsters, you may want that staff to pack a bit of a punch.  Here, I will temporarily enchant your weapon with a fire rod spell, go back out there and slay the Frost frond back there. Go kill $number of them. If your fire rod enchant wears off you can come back to me anytime for a boost. By the way, the fire rod spell, a real enchanter can temporarily or perminatly enchant any weapon, but I have a soft spot for stave wielders like yourself so I do staffs for free. Nothing else though. Feel free to ask me for a temporary enchant anytime. 

Orcmage1: that is great you took care of the Frost fronds. I am glad you now know the basics of using a stave. By the way, brooms are also staffs.

Undead1 – Staffs

Undeadmage1: Ah a staff wielder. Staffs are a weapon that will never die.  From the oldest walking stick to the newest rods, staffs give the fearsome appereance of a mage who can defend against anyone who gets near.  One hit from the staff will cause them to slow down or even stop in their tracks.  Here is a practice staff. I want you to hit that dummy over there for  awhile.

Undeadmage1: Wonderful, it is good to watch the straw fall out of that old dummy over there. Now, I think  you can kill real monsters with it. There is an ant hill over here. I want you to crush the ants before they eat too much of our food. Crush $number of them and then return to me. 


Undeadmage1: You crushed thoose dirty ants. Good. I know that typically staffs are used by wizards of various sorts as a helpful addition or enhancement to spellcasting. Spells of various sorts can be put into a staff that can not be put into any other type of weapon, making it an almost essential secondary skill for various magi. Speaking of something else that is essential... At one time I was weak, fresh from the grave. Other stronger undead tried to over take me. Even the other necromancers would laugh evily as I fell to the ground tripping over something, my spellbooks falling out of my arms. I want you to go over to the necromancer crypt, and hit $number of them with that staff. They don't know how to clean up in there, and keep all the most otherwise useless components. I think prehaps you will intrupt their concentration. 

(necromancers are moving around going to and froe, when you hit them with the staff, they say one of several random things.)
(when you hit her with the staff)
Necro1: What do you think you are doing?
Necro2: Don't touch my reagents with that broom.
Necro3: You better not even think of throwing out my gravedust.
Necro4: Undead these days, you need a broom safety course and a how to light candles class. 
Necro5: Even an idiot fool can use a broom properly, what is wrong with you.
Necro6: You are bit old and rotten to be swinging brooms around.
Necro7: Hey, that isn't a dragon bone. 
Necro8: Any idiot knows necromancers are  supposed to use daggers and not staffs.

Undeadmage1: That is great. I like it when the Necromancers get some sense beaten into them. I may not have a nose, but necro reagents are still the foulest things. They really need to sweep that place out sometime.  (you gain in vengence and humilation)

Undeadmage1: it is not entirely true that staffs do not do much damage. The damage they do can greatly be encreased by the enchant skill, up to the level of a lousy warrior weapon, and in some cases significantly more. Here, I will temporarily enchant your weapon with a silver rod spell, go back out there and slay the Grim wolves back there. Go kill $number of them. If your Silver rod enchant wears off you can come back to me anytime for a boost. By the way, the fire rod spell, a real enchanter can temporarily or perminatly enchant any weapon, but I have a soft spot for stave wielders like yourself so I do staffs for free. Nothing else though. Feel free to ask me for a temporary enchant anytime. 

Undeadmage1: that is great you took care of the grim wolves. I am glad you now know the basics of using a stave. By the way, brooms are also staffs, so that should clear up an confusion the necromancers may have given you.

Daggers Human
Human1: Ah the dagger.  No where else is there a more ancient yet very basic weapon. Daggers are not used solely for combat. In fact, that is not their main function.  They were always a tool of ritual and preparation, a modified knife, if you will. Here is a practice dagger, I want you to practice on thosse dummies there until you have the basics.  Thats right, just poke at them a bit.


Human1: Oh, thats good, I think you are ready to go out and try your dagger on your first real monster. Rats have always been a bit of a problem here. Those little nasties like to take over abandoned houses.  Go check out the old house out back and take out a few of them, say $number. 

Human1: So you have been killing things merely by using a dagger. That is rather slow and inefficient. There are actually several uses for daggers, and merely plunging a dagger into larger and bigger monsters won't cut it. Many monsters have  way to much armor for the dagger to be useful by itself. The key to effective dagger use is a through understanding of anatomy. Without that, a dagger merely leaves cuts and scrapes in various places. I want you to go to the library and read the tome on anatomy, return to me when you are done.

Human1: Ah, very good, you have read the tome on anatomy, now you can try something a bit harder. It is difficult to cut into lizards without knowing their weaknesses. Slay $ lizards for me with your new found knowledge. 

Human1: Thats great, you took good care of the lizards, but spears are not all about just poking at any monster you see. You need to understand that there are different types of daggers, most can be thrown, some are almost compeletly for the use of spell casters and do little to no damage when uses as a weapon, and only enhance spell effects. Here is a throwing dagger,  it can do damage from a distance, but does less damage over all.  The spider can bite and poison you if fought up close, but there is no danger in nailing the critters from a distance. Slay $number of them for me. When you have slain them, do not forget to take the poison saces from the spiders.  Bring me $number spider poison sacks as well. We really need them for the next part of the lesson.

Human1: It is good to see you have nailed those spiders.  Here, allow me to put the poison on your dagger. This will consist of the next lesson. Sometimes, you do not need much in the way of anatomical skill at all in order to kill something, merely cause the poison to sink into it.   The best monsters to test this out on are larger monsters that take a while to kill, for instance, ogres. Without the poison, stabing an orgre with a dagger would be useless at best, foolhardy at worst. Here, I want you to kill $number of ogres with the poison dagger. They can be found at the fort to the south.  

Human1: very good, you have killed the ogres. Do not forget that that was only the basics. That particular spider venom is not generaly very potent, but in that case it was. If you want to study the whole art of assassination, you will need to see someone else, prehaps someone at the shrine of vengence. If you want to study one of the mage disaplines that uses daggers try necromancy, at the shrine of indiscretion. 

Daggers Elf
Elf1: Ah the dagger, a great elf weapon.  No where else is there a more ancient yet very basic weapon. Daggers are not used solely for combat. In fact, that is not their main function.  They were always a tool of ritual and preparation, a modified knife, if you will. Here is a practice dagger, I want you to practice on thosse dummies there until you have the basics.  Thats right, just poke at them a bit.


Elf1: Oh, thats good, I think you are ready to go out and try your dagger on your first real monster.  Darters, small green bugs, have always been a bit of a problem here. Those little nasties like to take over gardens.  Go check out the old house out back and take out a few of them, say $number. 

Elf1: So you have been killing darters merely by using a dagger. That is rather slow and inefficient. There are actually several uses for daggers, and merely plunging a dagger into larger and bigger monsters won't cut it. Many monsters have  way to much armor for the dagger to be useful by itself. The key to effective dagger use is a through understanding of anatomy. Without that, a dagger merely leaves cuts and scrapes in various places. I want you to go to the library and read the tome on anatomy, return to me when you are done.

Elf1: I'm sure you enjoyed your trip to the library. It is good to hear that you have read through the anatomy book. Now you can try something a bit harder. It is difficult to cut into lizards without knowing their weaknesses. Slay $ lizards for me with your new found knowledge. 

Elf1: Thats great, you took good care of the lizards, but daggers are not all about just poking at any monster you see. You need to understand that there are different types of daggers, most can be thrown, some are almost completely for the use of spell casters and do little to no damage when uses as a weapon, and only enhance spell effects. Here is a throwing dagger,  it can do damage from a distance, but does less damage over all.  The spider can bite and poison you if fought up close, but there is no danger in nailing the critters from a distance. Slay $number of them for me. When you have slain them, do not forget to take the poison sacs from the spiders.  Bring me $number spider poison sacks as well. We really need them for the next part of the lesson.

Elf1: It is good to see you have nailed those spiders.  Here, allow me to put the poison on your dagger. This will consist of the next lesson. Sometimes, you do not need much in the way of anatomical skill at all in order to kill something, merely cause the poison to sink into it.   The best monsters to test this out on are larger monsters that take a while to kill, for instance, bears. Without the poison, stabbing a bear with a dagger would be useless at best, foolhardy at worst. Here, I want you to kill $number of bears with the poison dagger. They can be found at the cave to the south.  

Elf1: very good, you have killed the bears. Do not forget that that was only the basics. That particular spider venom is not generally very potent, but in that case it was. If you want to study the whole art of assassination, you will need to see someone else, perhaps someone at the shrine of vengeance. If you want to study one of the image disciplines that uses daggers try necromancy, at the shrine of indiscretion. 

Daggers Orc
Orc1: Ah the dagger, a typical all purpose tool and assassin weapon. Here is a practice dagger, I want you to practice on thosse dummies there until you have the basics.  Thats right, just poke at them a bit.

Orc1: Oh, thats good, I think you are ready to go out and try your dagger on something other than a practice dummy, your first real monster.  Giant gerbils have gotten into the trash piles. You would think they are cute little rodents.  Not so with the way they have taken over and bred. Unlike rats the desert dwelling rodents have furry tails. 

Orc1: So you have been killing giant gerbils merely by using a dagger. That is rather slow and inefficient. There are actually several uses for daggers, and merely plunging a dagger into larger and bigger monsters won't cut it. Many monsters have  way to much armor for the dagger to be useful by itself. The key to effective dagger use is a through understanding of anatomy. Without that, a dagger merely leaves cuts and scrapes in various places. I want you to go to the the shaman hut and ask a shaman to teach you anatomy. 

Shamanorc: what is it you want? I can not make you what I am merely by giving you a list of pointers on a chart. You are either die and are reborn into the proffession or not. Oh, anatomy. Yes, I can give you some basic pointers on creature anatomy. 

Orc1: It is good that you have learned how to stab with the dagger.  Now you can try something a bit harder. I thought giant gerbils were bad, but the lizards are worse. They breed even faster and are tougher, it seems. They don't need water to survive as even the girbils do, so they go farther out in the desert away from the trash piles. It is difficult to cut into lizards without knowing their weaknesses. Slay $ lizards for me with your new found knowledge. 

orc1: Thats great, you took good care of the lizards, but daggers are not all about just poking at any monster you see. You need to understand that there are different types of daggers, most can be thrown, some are almost completely for the use of spell casters and do little to no damage when uses as a weapon, and only enhance spell effects. Here is a throwing dagger,  it can do damage from a distance, but does less damage over all.  Just because it is dryer here than some other regions, does not mean we can avoid the spider. On the contrary. The spider can bite and poison you if fought up close, but there is no danger in nailing the critters from a distance. Slay $number of them for me. When you have slain them, do not forget to take the poison sacs from the spiders.  Bring me $number spider poison sacks as well. We really need them for the next part of the lesson.

Orc1: The only good spider, is a dead spider. Now that they are dead, the venom sacs can be put to use. Here, allow me to put the poison on your dagger. This will consist of the next lesson. Sometimes, you do not need much in the way of anatomical skill at all in order to kill something, merely cause the poison to sink into it.   The best monsters to test this out on are larger monsters that take a while to kill, for instance, bears. Without the poison, stabbing a bear with a dagger would be useless at best, foolhardy at worst. Here, I want you to kill $number of orges with the poison dagger. They can be found at the fort to the south.  

Orc1: You have killed the ogres. Do not forget that that was only the basics. That particular spider venom is not generally very potent, but in that case it was. If you want to study the whole art of assassination, you will need to see someone else, perhaps someone at the shrine of vengeance. If you want to study one of the image disciplines that uses daggers try necromancy, at the shrine of indiscretion. 

Daggers Undead
Undead1: Ah the dagger, an ancient and honnorable weapon.   It has been used for many things, a tool, a magic holding item, and yes even a weapon. It is this third use that we are going to focus on in your training here. After all, even if you primarly focus on one of a daggers other  uses, having as a weapon can come in handy.  Here is a practice dagger, I want you to practice on thosse dummies there until you have the basics.  Thats right, just poke at them a bit.

Undead1: Oh, thats good, I think you are ready to go out and try your dagger on something other than a practice dummy, your first real monster.  Undead rats have gotten in the crypts. I want you to kill $number of them.

Orc1: So you have been killing undead rats merely by using a dagger. That is rather slow and inefficient. There are actually several uses for daggers, and merely plunging a dagger into larger and bigger monsters won't cut it. Many monsters have  way to much armor for the dagger to be useful by itself. The key to effective dagger use is a through understanding of anatomy. Without that, a dagger merely leaves cuts and scrapes in various places. I want you to go the the libarary and read a tome on basic anatomy. This will allow you to better understand the use of a dagger.

Librarian: Our books on anatomy are old, but the pricincpals of anatomy are not. They have been the same for thousands of years, it is just that some did not care to observe them.

Librarian: what is it you want? I can not make you what I am merely by giving you a list of pointers on a chart. You are either die and are reborn into the proffession or not. Oh, anatomy. Yes, I can give you some basic pointers on creature anatomy. 

Undead1: It is good that you have learned how to stab with the dagger.  Now you have learned some anatomy you can try something a bit harder. I thought undead rats were bad, but the bats are worse. They breed even faster and are tougher, it seems. They fly through the air making a real annoyance of themselves. Go and slay $number of them please.

orc1: Thats great, you took good care of the bats, but daggers are not all about just poking at any monster you see. You need to understand that there are different types of daggers, most can be thrown, some are almost completely for the use of spell casters and do little to no damage when uses as a weapon, and only enhance spell effects. Here is a throwing dagger,  it can do damage from a distance, but does less damage over all.  Just because it is dryer here than some other regions, does not mean we can avoid the spider. On the contrary. The spider can bite and poison you if fought up close, but there is no danger in nailing the critters from a distance. Slay $number of them for me. When you have slain them, do not forget to take the poison sacs from the spiders.  Bring me $number spider poison sacks as well. We really need them for the next part of the lesson.

Undead1: It was a shame to kill the spiders, they spin such lovely webs. Well there are always more where those came from. Here, allow me to put the poison on your dagger. This will consist of the next lesson. Sometimes, you do not need much in the way of anatomical skill at all in order to kill something, merely cause the poison to sink into it.   The best monsters to test this out on are larger monsters that take a while to kill, for instance, Werewolves. Without the poison, stabbing a werewolf with a dagger would be useless at best, foolhardy at worst. Here, I want you to kill $number of werewolves with the poison dagger. They can be found at the fort to the north.  

Undead1: You have killed the werewolves. Do not forget that that was only the basics. That particular spider venom is not generally very potent, but in that case it was.

If you want to study one of the image disciplines that uses daggers try necromancy, at the shrine of indiscretion. 

Part III The magic discipline  quests
Necromancy

(location shrine of indiscretion)

Necromancer1: I assume you were directed here to the shrine of indiscretion for more advanced training than what can be found in your home town yes? Let me be blunt with you, those small spells you learned in town are not the majority of necromancy. It is all that we can teach to the uninitiated.  But you did not come to hear me lament the shortcoming of the common people.  They do not really want to know how we get most of our necessary components for spells or how we really make those fabulous wants that allow us to command even the most wayward souls. 
If you wish to continue down the necromantic path, you must return to a new necromantic trainer, from any town, or even the ones standing outside the haunted insane asylum. There you must tell them what you truly think of them. That the dead must be destroyed and not allowed to rest. We are not clerics after all. 

Neocronewbtrainer: What is it young necromancer?

You: I have come to tell you that the dead must really be disturbed and that you are a fool for not aknowledging it.

Neocronewbtrainer: I have taught you all that I know. Anything else you learn you learn at your own peril. I can not help you any further. 

Necromancer1: Good, with that out of the way, now I can test the rest of your ability before progressing  your studies further. You may think you are done with having teachers, but you are far from it. You have merely traded one instructor for another. 

Necromancer1: Your first task will be to bring me some grave dust, what is that? Why it is dust from a grave, fool, That is right go dig some up with a shovel, use the shovel on the grave and take that first handful of dirt. You might dig up a zombie, but they are easy to kill. Come back when you have the gravedirt.

Necromancer1: Good, you have the gravedirt. Now let me show you how you use it. Gravedirt is needed for many basic necromancer spells and skills. The first of these is tame undead. Use one grave dirt on any skeleton or zombie. You can go to any graveyard now and command a skeleton or zombie just as you would a pet. You only get one at a time though, and beccause you do not know how to construct them yet, they will not follow you out.

Necromancer1:  Now that you have practiced a bit with this, I bet you would like the ability to have the dead help you out at places other than graveyards. The best way to do this is to put zombies together on the spot. Every monster you kill is a potential zombie or skeleton. You  just need to imbue the corpse with life. Zombies are lower level, and faster to make. Take this grave dust and the new summon zombie spell, remember, as soon as you kill a creature, you can raise it as a zombie. You are limited to $number zombies at a time however. Practice this until you have mastered it.

Necromancer1: Skeletons are a bit harder, but well worth the extra effort in most cases, the exception being places where monsters do a lot of bashing damage, since this is where skeletons are weaker. For that you will need to get bones from the corpse. Use a dagger or other blade onn the corpse to get bones, then add grave dust. Then you have a skeletal friend to help you out. Practice until you have mastered this.

Neromancer1: Depending on what you kill, a skeleton may bee weaker or stronger thatn the monster. Why is this? Well, because the skeleton is not the original monsters skeleton, but a necromantic reconsitution. There are even higher level monsters you can craft. 



Bard Quests: (found at the shrine of Lust)
Bard1: I see that you have taken a liking to  my music. Prehaps someday you will be able to play better than me. Your first task is to purchase an instrument, any instrument will do.  Without something to play on, bard skills are completely worthless. 

bard1: I see you have taken an intrest in music and would like to become a bard. You can't expect to just purchase an insturment and then practice until your heart is content, and then automatically be a perfect bard. Bard skills demand training and disapline. Your next task is to aquaire some sheet music. You should be able to purchase it from the store, or from other players. Music sheets are very much like spells. You can either 'play from the sheet' or have it memorized. It requires a number of times playing from the sheet before you will have it memorized. Once a song is memorized, you always have it at your disposel.

Bard1: Oh, that sheet is too hard for your skill level. You should save it for later when you have mastered more things. Here, I will give you this easy tune. This simple tune allows one to boost the hit chance of all party members. Unlike spells, tunes don't wear off, but only one can be active on a party at a time. After the song is played, it will stay on you, and you can continue to use it. 

Bard1: Now that you have mastered your first tune, you are ready to try something a bit harder. This one does not work on your party at all, but instead incites two monsters to fight eachother. It won't be very strong at first. You will need to learn more songs in order to get it stronger. 

Bard1: Come back when you have mastered at least 5 songs in the easy category.

Bard1: actually, I am only an apprentice bard myself, i cannot teach your more, prehaps you better move on to taking more advaned work. If you want such things, you would be better off learning from $bard2 over there. 

Bard2: Hello, it appears you are well on your way to becoming a great bard. Being a bard is more than learning songs. It is all about traveling the world and seeing what is all about, playing in different venues. In order for you to learn medium level songs, you are going to need to play in different venues.  There are four venues scattered through the world, Forest glen Tavern, near the elvish city, Dragon's Den,  right outside the human city, Blackwater Inn, near the undead town, and the Gutted Boar, near the orc town.  You must visit each of the venues and pick up proof of your visit in the form of a card, and play at least one song while you are there.

Bard2: hello, did you do as I requested? Yes, you did. You can now learn medium level songs, do not bother me anymore until you have learned at least 3 of thesse songs.

Bard2: I'm sorry, I am only an Expert bard myself.  I  have no claim to fame, My name will never be sung the praises of while slaying dragons in my sleep like it seems with the legendary bards. If you want to be a lengend, just like every other great proffession, you must go to to hell. Yes, that is right, the dungeon hell. We may not speak of it much but here this song.

Oh dark of night.
Oh savage light.
My soul takes flight.
To hell I go 
Where no one does know.
The pain and sorrow that I feel.
Without this the music is not even real.
All the heros must go to hell.
Before they can be proclaimed the fools they are.
And then become the rising stars.

I know not the meaning of this, for I have never been to hell and do not want to go. If you decide to take this up it will be at your own peril, for you will be in great danger. Greater danger than  you  have ever faced.

Mage quest: takes place at the shrine of Humiliation

mage1: How does it feel to be humiliated? That is how you will feel when you go to the shrine of skeptisism and try to cast some spells.  But fortunatly, throughot the rest of the world, they will work. Assming you have gotten the very basic spells all done already, now it is time for you to learn a bit more.  Spells are not free to cast for the most part. You need speacial items to cast them. 

Keyword items

Mage: You must be wielding a magical weapon in order to cast spells, the magical weapon is an ordinary weapon that has been enchanted to allow the caster to channel the magical ether that is all around us.

Mage1: There are five branches of magic: elemental, blood, shaman, enchant, and Necromancy

Keyword blood:

Mage1: blood is a strange kind of magick that uses hitpoints and foodpoints as well as or instead of mana. You have to be careful  how much you use that you don't end up draining yourself over much with the spells. On the other hand some things can only  be done with blood magick.  Bloodmages are taught at the shrine of masochism while elementalist are taught here. 

Keyword elemental:

Mage1: Elemental is the clasic kind of magic using the four elemental powers, earth, air, fire and water. The four shrines can be found, fought at and entered into. It is there that you will have to do your elemental quests. You will also have to find the wild elementals and tame them. Be careful, the elementals can be dangereous.

Keyword shaman:

Mage1: There is no more difficult magick than this one, or rather it is the one that comes at the highest cost. All mages go to hell, but this mage losses more than most. 

Keyword enchant:

Mage1: both elementalists and blood mages can enchant items. Of course, for the blood mage it takes hit points as well as mana. In addition to the requise mage type,  you also need the requise craft skill to make a perminate enchantment, although both types of mages can make weaker temporary enchantments.

Keyword summon: Both elementalists and bloodmages can summon, but the creatues they summon differ. Elementalist can summon the elemental creatures, but bloodmages summon daemons. Daemons are supposed to be the most important and powerful creatures in the world. Bloodmages can also summon lesser daemons to fight monsters.  

Keyword necromancer, necromancey.

Mage1: Technically necromancy is not a branch of magic. All the same, it does not work at the skeptisism shrine or in the skeptisism dungeon. This seems a bit strange considerig that bard skills and taming do work there. The bard skill seem strange because it produces magick like effects, but some how the skeptics believe in music.  The taming seems strange to since you are controling other animals. 

Keyword skeptic skepisism

Mage1: anything you learn as a mage or necromancer is useless in the skeptic shrine and dungeon. They believe in materialism, so therefore magick,that bends the material reality does not work. Also they believe that once you die that is it, therefore there are no dead spirits or reanimated corpses to practice necromancy on. 

Mage1: I understand that you want to learn the elemental spells.  All elements are equalilly difficult with a gradiant of spells going up in difficulty. Each element can be leveled seperatly, meaning you do not need to be great at air spells, even at level one to learn fire spells. So therefore it almost seems like an elementalist mage is four different skills. But there is a fifth skill, elementalist that boosts all of them up.  The four elements are earth, air, water and fire. Everyone should know that. Ask me about any of them to get the requise quests.

Keyword air

Mage1: you can buy or receive the air scrolls, come to me when you have them.

Mage1: I see you have the air scrolls. That is good,  now use them. I want  you to practice the air spells until you have mastered level one.
Mage1: that is good, i see you  have mastered level one of air. Now, in order to learn more, you will need to go to the shrine of air and talk to the slyph there.

Slyph(shrine of air): Hello, oh, I see you are a budding air elementalist. Control of the element of air is one thing  you need to master. In order to do this it must be balanced with earth. Go to the earth shrine and slay $number earthlings. Do  not come back until you have.

Slyph: good, now you may learn any level 2 spells that you wish. Practice that level till you have mastered that.

Slyph: the balance between air and earth must be mentained. Go to the earth shrine and slay $gnomes. Do not come back until you do. 

Slyph: Oh, I see you have completed your task, you may now learn level 3 spells. Practice till  you have mastered them and then I have one more quest for you.

Slyph: The balance always tips in favor of earth, and lightning is drawn to the earth like fire to water. Go now and slay $number earth elementals. Do not come back until you do. I am waiting for  you now.

Slyph: oh that is good, you may now learn level four spells, do not come back until you have mastered them.

Slyph: You will need to go to hell to gain the final level of spells in air. It seems that you should be able to gain that just by visiting the shrines, but I am afraid that is not possible. There are four entrances to hell, There is one close to this shrine, the being you need is close to that entrance. After all, you do not have to go that far down to master the elemental  magicks. 

Keyword earth

Mage1: You can buy or receive the earth scrolls, come to me when you have them.

Mage1: I see you have the earth scrolls. That is good,  now use them. I want  you to practice the air spells until you have mastered level one.
Mage1: That is good, i see you  have mastered level one of earth. Now, in order to learn more, you will need to go to the shrine of earth and talk to the gnome there.

Gnome(shrine of earth): The earth has called to you, and thus you are ready to learn its secrets. Control of the element of earth is one thing  you need to master. In order to do this it must be balanced with air. Go to the air shrine and slay $number lightlings. Do not come back until you have do this thing.

Gnome: Great, now you may learn any level 2 spells that you wish. Practice that level till you have mastered that.

Gnome: Compared to the gnomes, there are too many slyphs.   Go to the air shrine and slay $slyphs. Do not come back until you do. 

Gnome: Well well, your task is now complete. You may now learn level 3 spells. Practice till  you have mastered them and then I have one more quest for you.

Gnome: They say lightning never strikes twice, but it keeps on striking. The balance always tips in favor of air, and earth receives lightnings like water receives fire.  Go now and slay $number air elementals. Do not come back until you do. I am waiting for  you now.

Gnome: Great, you may now learn level four spells, do not come back until you have mastered them.

Gnome: I have taught you all that I can teach. It is necessary for you to go to hell for the final level of earth magic, because it is deep in the earth. It seems that you should be able to gain that just by visiting the shrines, but I am afraid that is not possible. There are four entrances to hell, There is one close to this shrine, the being you need is close to that entrance. After all, you do not have to go that far down to the pits of hell. 

Keyword water

Mage1: You can buy or receive the water scrolls, come to me when you have them.

Mage1: I see you have the water scrolls. That is good,  now use them. I want  you to practice the water spells until you have mastered level one.

Mage1: That is good, I see you  have mastered level one of water. Now, in order to learn more, you will need to go to the shrine of water and talk to the undine there.

Undine(shrine of water): The waters have called you. Swim with me under the great sea. What? You can't breathe under there yet? Perhaps if you learn enough water magick I will be able to teach you that.  Controling the elemental of water, well water is impossiable to control, it ebs and flows, even in its solid state, it is ice, stillness. It puts out fires.  I want you to put out the fires.  Go to the fire shrine and slay $number firelings for me. I am waiting for you.  

Undine: Great, now you may learn any level 2 water spells that you wish. Practice that level till you have mastered that.

Undine: Water is emotion, a feeling. It fights its opposite, the sparks of burning fire that are the will. Salamanders crawl through the fire shrine, burning bright in the hands of the mage concentrated with fire. Put out the fires and sink into the waters. Go now to the fire shrine and put out $number salamanders. I am waiting for you here. 

Undine: Well well, your task is now complete. You may now learn level 3 spells. Practice till  you have mastered them and then I have one more quest for you.

Undine: Like water, fire is an element.  It burns it destroys all in its path. Water is the bringer of life. Yet, to the other they can be the opposite. Fire can destroy water, and water can destroy fire. I need you to quench the fires at the fire shrine. Please, put out $number fire elementals for me. Watch them turn to ash.  Yes, do it for me. Return to me when you have done as I have asked.

Mage1: That is good, I see you  have mastered level one of fire. Now, in order to learn more, you will need to go to the shrine of fire and talk to the salamander there.

Salamander(shrine of fire): The fire burns with in you. I can see the flames shine in your eyes. Fire is a powerful ally, and a dangerous enemy. Fire is what allows the races of wograld to rise above all the other creatures. The orcs fires burn brightly in their camps, the human fires burn in their hearts, the elfish fire burns at their shrines and the undead fire burns in their eyes. Yet without control fire is a mere element, a force of nature.  Sometimes the fire gets put out by water. But we must burn it continuously.

Salamander: Now you may learn any level 2 water spells that you wish. Practice that level till you have mastered that.

Bloodmage – shrine of Masochism.

Bloodmage1: So you are interested in the art of blood magic.  That is you are interested in using your own life force in the casting of spells. Be warned, it is a dangerous path that can kill the over zealous mage. If you are asking how you can get started, you will need a dagger. Any dagger will do, as I will enchant it for you to allow bloodletting, and at the same time remove any previous enchantment, so I suggest something simple and plain.

Bloodmage1:ah, you have the dagger. Very good, Yes, daggers are easy to come by in these parts, neophyte blacksmiths throw them away all the time, as do monsters who have no concept of their real usage. Now, take the dagger, and cut yourself with it. (this means click on the dagger and target self)
Bloodmage1: Did that hurt? Yes it did, you will be doing far more of that if you want to go far in bloodmagic. Bloodmagic is not just about hurting yourself like the masochist you are, but about harming your eneimeis, and enimies are common through out Wograld. The dagger is now bonded to you, and only to you. Through it you can cast bloodmagic spells. Should you lose this dagger, you will need to repeat the process with another weapon.

Assassin – shrine of Vengence

Assassin1: Do you know who I am? No you do not, this is just a name and an apperance that I am using now. You may ask me about the art of assassination anytime, but we will need to go somewhere more descret.

Keyword: assassin.

Assassin1: Come closer and follow me off to the side (you follow the assassin through a teleporter and into a small room.

Assassin: Now then, we may speak freely, what is it that you wish to  learn. Basic daggers? Basic Poisoning? Basic Invisablity?

Keyword daggers:
Assassin:If you never managed to get the dagger training from your races trainer for what ever reason, I am fully quailfied to give the same quests they would give you, modified of course for this location. The monsters and terrain are slightly harder over here though, so it is probably easier to get it from your race town if you still can. 

Keyword Poisoning:
Assassin: I know several different poisons that I can teach you to obtain and use step by step. In so many places people think it is one thing poison, in reality it is many things, some of them more dangerous than others.

Keyword Invisibiltiy:
Assassin, this skill is not invisibility as such, but I can teach you how to hide, how to stealth, and the use of various disguises. 

Tamer – found at the shrine of paranoia

Tamer1: Animals know things before we do. That is how we know that something is amiss, when the animals leave an area. There is much you have to do to understand the ways of the animals. There is a very simple trick to get animals to like you, start with something easy like a bird or a cat, get some food, such as bird seed or tuna fish, set it out and then the animal will come close to you. You can start speaking calmly to it, and it will start to  like you. (use the taming skill) Once you have got it on your side, you can even take it with  you using a pet container.  You can buy them here or get a tinkerer to make them for you. Bring back a tame animal in the cage to me so that I can see you have progressed.

Tamer1: Good job with the easy animal.  Not all animals are so easy. Some are larger in size and would not fit into the container. That is why you need a whistle to call them with. You can easily get a carpentor to make you a speacial whistle. Or you can buy one in a store. Each whistle can only be used for one pet at a time, and you are limited to $number of pets.  Now, I want you to try a harder animal, such as a deer, or cow.  Both thosse animals like grass, so you do not have to feed them to get them to come near. 

Tamer1: Good job, I see that the $animal comes when you whistle. You have an excellent start. But I think that these sorts of animals are too easy and not strong enough. You need more of a predator to help you fight tough monsters, something like wolf, a puma or a bear. But thosse animals can be dangerous and get you hurt if you are not careful. I will follow you when you ask, i want you to lead me to a spot where you see one of those animals. Then, I will set out a piece of meat. I will show you how it is done. Then I will ask you to try it. If it gets aggressive you must step slowly away from it. Do  not allow it to maul you.  When  you have it tamed, you also use the whistle with these animals. 

Tamer1: Ready, see how I lay this meat on the ground the closest $animal is coming closer. Look, it is sniffing at the meat now I can move in (tamer1 uses tamer skill.) Look at it, isn't it tame now. Now you try, there is another $animal over there for you to try to get.

Tamer1: I see you have sucessed with this. Those are the easiest aniamsl to tame. The harder ones I can not teach your directly. Personally, I believe they are too dangerous to bother with, but since you are aiming to be a fool, I will tell you anyway. You can continue this method to  learn to tame magical beasts such as wyverns, nightmares, and yes, even dragons. Good luck on your quest, because you must tame the monsters before it slays you. 

Beserker (found at the shrine of Foolhardiness) 

Beserker1: So you have decided to become a Beserker. Know this, a beserker is a not a mere warrior, but the strongest most awsome mightest warrior there ever is. Beserkers take on aspects of beasts in order that they might fight more savagely. However, it comes with limitations. You can only use certain skills while in wereform.  Your first task will be to learn to shapeshift into wereform. In order to do this, you must go to the shrine of the Moon.  It is near elfish lands. There you must place four things on the alter, large cat, wolf, or bear fur (obtained from a large cat, wolf, or bear) depending on the form you want to change into.  A moon cookie, theese can ussually be purchased at the tavern and are also a common cooking recipe. You must also place a large slab of meat of any sort.  The last item you need is the sigil of foolhardiness. It is easy to get, just go to the foolhardiness shrine and ask around for one. After you have placed the four items on the alter and felt something, return to me. 

(go to the shirne of foolhardiness)

Questperson: So you are looking for the sigil of foolhardiness. I can give thee one. Here it is. Everyone will know what a fool you are now.

(go to the shrine of the moon)

*You feel a strange change within your being. The full moon strangly appears overhead, you don't remember seeing this before. (bear cat or wolf sounds in the distance depending on the fur you used)

*you feel normal again, but the items have disappeared, you have definatly felt something, return to the Beserker* 

Beserker1: ah, so you did change, You yet have little control over being able to make this change. It is crucial that you learn to control it, else it will not be there when  you need it, or perhaps be there when you don't want it to be there. I will now touch you. There, you have now become aware of it. Use it from  your skill menu to change into wereform. Use the other one to change back. While in were form you have certain limitations.

Thievery – Thief

Thief1: so you want to be a thief? Well you are going ot have to steal things. It is not like other proffessions. It is better not to advertise who you are, because no one wants to be stolen from. Even assassins make themselves more known in order to get contracts. The first thing you need to learn is that anyone can steal, but it takes skill to be good at it. The following skills may be of use to you, Invisibility, and Disenchant.

Invisibility

Thief1: the assassins also teach this skill, it allows you to walk about unseen and wear disguises so you blend into the crowd or wherever you are. 

Thief1: Your first invisibility quest will be in the use of disguises. It is not enough to purchase new clothing, and dye your hair, you must also change your voice and manner, else others will recognize who you are. The best way to do this temporarly is through magic glammors.  You may pick a new name for the prospect of this shapeshift. It is actually much like a werekin shapeshift in some regard. The easiest to accomplish is changing to a creature of your same gender and race, second is to change gender, but not race, and third is to also be able to change your racail apperance. Of couse the main difficulty is maintaining the illusion, but it is better than being stuck that way is it not. Level one kits can be made by a tailor, level two kits can also be made by a tailor, level3 requires a tailor with enchant powers to enchant it as well. Once the hour is up they wear off, so you will have to use a new kit for each hour you want to hold the change. 

Thief1: Your second invisibility quest will be to hide yourself while standing still. 

Thief1: Your last invisibiility quest will be to hide yourself while mov
Keyword Disenchant

The ultimate looting skill. Sometimes chest and  things have traps. Other people tend to enchant their items so they can not be looted except by the owner or they go boom. Other people have items made designed to hit a certain target.  Well, if you know what you are doing, none of that stuff will ever hurt you. That is what is wonderful about this skill. It also allows you to take appart items into components, making the thief, or rogue a valuable friend.

Part V The Basic Skills and quests

npcmage1: Everyone should learn a little bit of basic magic.  There are a few spells everyone will learn and know even if they know nothing else of magic power.  These spells are portal, heal minor, ignite and teleport. Without these basic abilities, things would be much more difficult. The first one of these, portal, allows the caster to open a gate from most locations in the world to a previously designated location. The second one heal minor, is very important. Without a way to patch oneself and others in emergencies we would be in dire straights indeed.  The spell does have its limitations though, but it does allow one to regain health fast instantly, although it is only a small amount. The third spell, teleport, is similar to the first one, portal, but with one major different, the location does not need to be known prior to casting the spell, but it must be reachable, that is close by. It is not a spell to use often for it uses all ones mana points. Some new mages get the idea that they can drink mana potions all day and then teleport all over. Not so.  One telport will exsust oneself for a few moments. Ignite is a simple spell that allows one to start fires provided kindling is present, wether in the form of wood scraps a torch or a candle. It is great for practicing lighting things. 

Cooking

cook1: There are several different kinds of recipes and ways that one can cook. The simplest way is over a fire, boiling or lettering the cauldron to get very hot so the water comes off the top.  The second way is simmering where e you allow the ashes to to simmer the food for a while.  When  you get good, you can learn broiling, or the art of cooking under a fire. Then you can go unto baking, that is merely allowing the item to sit in the heat for a while, you can also learn thee art of frying, something you should only do as a last resort as too much frying can make you ill. Recipes can be divided into these categories, they are boiling, simmering, broiling, baking, and frying.  They are actually five separate skills, rather than just plain old cooking. Some recipes require more than one skill. For instance this recipe. Fried casserole, requires baking and frying. Other than that you need a cooking pot and a fire. Well actually, you need several kinds of pots.

1) Fairy Dusty - Yet another quest about fairy dust
2)Diplomatic Spell - A polite wizard casts a spell on you to be nice. Unfortunately, some people want to hear the unvarnished brutal truth. 
3) Door Knobs and Broomsticks - the long awaited sequel to Fairy Dusty, clean the door knobs with an
animated broomstick, just make sure it doesn't get out of control.


Fairy Dusty
In fairy dusty, you start in a room filled with fairies and fairy dust. Dust is everywhere.  Outside is a street sweeper sweeping the road.

Sweeper: Oh those dirty faeries.

You: What is dirty about them?

Sweeper: That awful dust, it makes me sneeze, can't they learn to care about us with allergies.

You: Sorry to hear that.

Sweeper: Since I have such bad allergies, would you go inside and clean it up for me. I'm supposed to keep this town clean, but with my allergies, I just can't do it.

YOu: What do you want me to do.

Sweeper; Here is a broom. (hands you a  broom) I know this isn't a nice very hight quality magick enchanged broom and it doesn't teleport you anywhere, but it should be more than sufficent to sweep up the fairy dust, and here is a dustpan too (hands you a dustpan) Now, go inside that fairy house and clean it out good. I want you to clean every room. Get all the dust off the floor and throw it outside where it can't bother my allergies like it does in an enclosed space.

(You go inside and start sweeping up dust, before you can fill a dust pan, a fairy stops you)
Fairy: Just what do you think you are doing?

You: Cleaning up.

Fairy: That is not cleaning that's ruining it.  

You: How so?

Fairy: Fairy dust is magical and essential to us faires. We use it for all kinds of important things.

You: LIke what?

Fairy: It's a secret, but you can't just steal it like that!

You: Why not?

Fairy: cause we won't let you.

You: (to yourself) I've got to find some way to get the dust out of here without the fairies noticing. 

(Talk to the street sweeper again)

You: I know you told me to clean the faires house, but they won't let me.

Sweeper: Maybe if they were sleeping.

You: Since when do faires sleep? It seems like one or another of them is always awake.

Sweeper: You could go see the local herbalist in his shop about that. He always has something good for my allergy symptoms that lets me sleep through the night, I'm sure he has something for fairies so they will sleep right through your cleaning. 

Herbalist: What can I do for you (m'lady, good sir)?

You: I need something to help a fairy sleep.

Herbalist: A good rest always is a good way to heal what ails.  I understand it must be difficult for fairies to get a good rest with all the hard work that they do.  For fairies, I recomend the sleepy plant. It is a nice looking plant with leaves like a z. For some reason it doesn't work on other species though, just faires.  You will need to mix it up in a form they can handle though, so if you would sweep some dust from the corner over there and get me three sleepy plant leaves, that should give you enough for a whole busy house of fairies to get a good nights sleep.

(after bringing back ingredients.)

Herbalist: I see you have the leaves and dust, let me mix this up for you.

Herbalist: There you go, be sure to give it to them in safe place. They are more vulnerable when they sleep.
 

(You go back to the fairy house and sprinkle the fairy dust with the sleepy plant around)

Fairy: Ah, thats the spirit, I'm glad you finnally see our way of dusting thingzzzzzz zzzzz. (fairy falls asleep.)

(You go around the fairy house and collect the fairy dust, putting in in the pan.  You open the door to walk out of the house (teleports don't work in the fairy house)

Stranger: Oh, hello there, nice to meet you.  Its great to see the fairies have brough you into the trust of thier secrets.

You: Secrets?

Stranger: Why, I mean the fairy dust of course.  Its quite valuable, would you like to sell me some.
( sell him some of it at 5000 gp or all at 10,000)

Stranger: Yes, very good, remember fairy dust is a very valuable commodity.  I don't know if you noticed, but it sells for quite a lot on the markets. And the only way, my dear to get it is to be able to get some from the fairies, and they don't sell you just anyone you know, if you know what I mean.

You: Yes, I do.  I'm just cleaning up.

Stranger: Well, that is good to hear.  I will be on my way now. Don't forget to collect your reward from the street sweeper.  

(stranger disappears.  You find the street sweeper you talked to to start the quest.) 

Street Sweeper: Did you clean up the fairy dust like I asked you to?

You: Yes, I did, and I found out that fairy dust is worth money.

Sweeper: Even if it is worth something, I still would have thrown it out. It is too much trouble to take it to market. 

You: Dont' I get a reward.

Sweeper: I was going to reward you with a ribbon, but I threw it out, it wasn't in very good shape anyway. 

You: Urughhh.

Sweeper: But I might have another task for you.

You: I'm not doing any more stupid tasks for you, you ask me to do something, and then fail to pay up.

Sweeper: There is a young man I have fallen in love with. The problem is he does not love me. He says I am too homely and have too many allergies. I want him to fall in love with me, and feel the attraction to me that I feel for him. His name is Bardick, and he is a chimney sweep. Will you go to him and do this for me.

You: I will try and see what I can do.

Sweeper: Thank you so much for helping out a plain girl like me. You will be justly rewarded.

You: I'm not sure about the justly rewarded part, but okay.
