<H1 align=center>Loading archetypes and maps</H1>

<H2>Archetypes</H2>

<P>First off: What are Crossfire Arches? - They are the definitions of default
    objects, for example an ordinary orc, a door or standard food. These
    archetypes are vital for the editor and you can't work without them.</P>

<P>It is very important to know that there are two ways to load the archetypes:

<ol>

    <LI><P>Load it from collected archive files. These are included in your
        editor and per default, these get loaded. Hence, if you don't want to
        care about archetypes, there's no need to worry about that.</P>

    <LI><P>Download the Crossfire arch package. You can download it either
        directly from SVN or from the download area on the Crossfire project.
        Both of these can be found at
        <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/crossfire/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/crossfire/</A>).
    </P>

        <P>Once you've got the arch folder, you must <B>set the path</B> to this
            folder. Select the menu "File-&gt;Options...", un-check the box
            "Load Arches from Collection", then enter the path in "Arch". When
            you're at it, you can also customize the default map-path.</P>

        <P>Now you're ready to go. Click OK, quit the editor and restart it.
            This time the archetypes will load from all the individual arch and
            image files. You will notice that the editor takes about three times
            longer to load that way.</P>

</ol>
<P>You might ask yourself now: "Why should I spend my time downloading the arch
    package only to find out it takes three times longer to load?". Well, at
    some point during map making you will probably want to modify an archetype,
    create new archetypes or new images. And for that task, you need to have the
    individual archetype files in extracted form. However, don't worry too much
    about the loading time. You can collect the arches after modifying/adding
    what you want (see menu: "Resources-&gt;Collect Arches"). This will create
    new collected archives so you can both have your changes and load in short
    time.</P>

<H2>Maps</H2>

<P>Concerning maps: You don't necessarily need to have the Crossfire maps. You
    can just head off creating your own maps. Though, most likely you will
    notice that Crossfire map making isn't all that easy, and you'll want to
    have working examples to look at. Besides, you will want to link your maps
    into the existing Crossfire world and probably you'll want to test them too.
    For all of that you need the Crossfire map package.</P>

<P>Like the archetypes, you can get the maps either directly from SVN or
    download the package. See
    <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/crossfire/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/crossfire/</A>.
    Don't forget to set the default map path to your local map directory (menu
    "File-&gt;Options...").</P>

<P>Note that there is a special convenience option for browsing through maps:
    The "<B>enter exit</B>"-feature. You will probably know that in the
    Crossfire game, maps are linked to each other via so-called exits (doors,
    teleporters, buildings etc). You can select any such exit on a map (left
    click on it), then activate the menu "Map-&gt;Enter Exit" (or just hit
    &ltStrg&gt + &ltE&gt) and the map that this exit is pointing to gets loaded.
