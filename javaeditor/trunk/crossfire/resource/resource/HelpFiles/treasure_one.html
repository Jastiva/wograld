<h1>Treasurelists producing one item</h1>

<p>You can recognize this type of treasurelist by the icon:
    <img src="treasureone_list.png" width="32" height="20" align="bottom" alt="[one]">,
    as well as the name ending with "[one]". Such a treasurelist produces always
    exactly one item from the list. The objects on the list can have different
    chances set (the %-values in brackets), which indicate that some items are
    more likely to get chosen, and other less likely.</p>

<h2>Examples for treasurelists producing one item</h2>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src="treasure1.jpg" width="219" height="155" align="center" alt="Treasure list 'dragon_parts'">
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="treasure2.jpg" width="257" height="87" align="center" alt="Treasure list 'traps'">
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>As you can see in the right hand side example, treasurelists may contain yet
    other treasurelists. If chosen, such sub-lists get processed in recursive
    fashion. You can view the contents of each sub-list by clicking on the
    expand-mark. </p>
