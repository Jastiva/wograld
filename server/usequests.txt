Using Quest Code:

a quest is given to a player character when they step on a square having a "marker".
Right now there is not an easy way to link this to an NPC, however
the NPC can direct you to step in a teleporter to a room having a marker.

the marker has a
"slaying" which names the quest to be added to the player
and an optional "name" which names the previous quest in a sequence that is removed
from the player
and a description of the format
"lore"
< description >
"endlore"

that is written to the quest.

The quest will appear in the player.pl file having the quest name
as "slaying"  and the description of the format

"lore"
< description >
"endlore"

the player can hold zero or one or more quest sequences at a time
(one quest of each sequence).
The end of a quest sequence, having record of its being done,
is also stored to them (no more to be done for it).

the player character looks up progress on quest sequences using
the following:

"questlist" lists quests
"aboutquest <questname> outputs lore for the quest

TODO:   client displays label list for quests
      user pushing a label requests aboutquest <name>
        logging in or stepping on a marker has server push what
        would be reply to "questlist" to update the label list window


A format inside of "lore" that would be helpful but is not yet managed by software:

Each quest sequence has a begin "gadget" of 3 chambers
and one or more next-step "gadgets" of 3 chambers.

It is possible to scatter the chambers across a map
or across the world but it would be confusing to players.

The first chamber is a teleporter or door to the second chamber
that can check for progress on the previous quest in the sequence.

The second chamber has an altar to receive the quest item once you
have it, using it to control access to the third chamber.
for the begin of a quest sequence this has a marker that assigns
the first quest.   the second chamber should tell the player
where to go for the quest item.

the third chamber has a marker that assigns the next quest.
if it is the second or latr gadget of a sequence,
it removes the previous quest in the sequence from the player.
the third chamber is also able to drop a quest reward.
the third chamber or the next quest lore, should tell the player
where to go to get the next quest, and possibly where to go for the
quest item.
